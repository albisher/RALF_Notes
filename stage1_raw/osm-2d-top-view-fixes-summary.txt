### SUMMARY
Summary of unresolved OSM 2D top-view tile loading issues after partial fixes for 3D/2D mode switching and synchronization.

### DETAILS
This document outlines fixes for OSM integration issues in a GIS application, focusing on resolving 3D/2D mode switching and crosshair alignment. While 3D isometric view and crosshair alignment work correctly, the 2D top-view remains a black screen due to unresolved tile loading problems. The summary details attempted fixes, including camera positioning, imagery layer visibility, and scene mode adjustments.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`update2DTopView`**: Updated camera positioning logic with fallbacks for 2D mode.
- **`syncViewsToLocation`**: Synchronization function for 2D and 3D views post-initialization.
- **`osm-integration-box.js`**: Core file handling OSM integration, scene mode locking, and imagery layer visibility checks.

### DEPENDENCIES
Cesium.js, OSM (OpenStreetMap) data layers, GIS visualization libraries.

### USAGE
The document serves as a reference for developers troubleshooting OSM tile loading in 2D top-view mode, suggesting alternative approaches like COLUMBUS_VIEW mode or debugging network requests.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Attempts to use `SCENE2D` mode for 2D top-view have not resolved tile loading; consider switching to `COLUMBUS_VIEW` as a workaround.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Black screen in 2D top-view may indicate network issues or Cesium version-specific bugs; verify tile requests and imagery layer visibility.
