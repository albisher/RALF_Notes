### SUMMARY
Automated end-to-end testing framework for a web application using Puppeteer to validate Vue.js components and capture screenshots.

### DETAILS
This script implements a comprehensive automated test suite for a web application hosted on `localhost:8443`. It uses Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, navigate through multiple pages, and verify the presence of a Vue.js application container (`#app`). The test suite captures screenshots of each page for debugging and logs test results, including pass/fail counts. The `runAllTests()` method orchestrates the entire workflow, including browser initialization, test execution, and cleanup.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`ComprehensiveWorkingTest`**: Main class encapsulating test logic, including initialization, screenshot capture, and page validation.
  - **`init()`**: Creates a directory for screenshots if it doesn’t exist.
  - **`takeScreenshot(page, filename)`**: Captures a full-page screenshot and saves it to a specified directory.
  - **`testPage(page, url, pageName)`**: Validates a single page by checking for the Vue app container and logging results.
- **`runAllTests()`**: Orchestrates the full test suite, launching a browser, executing tests, and reporting results.
- **`main()`**: Entry point that instantiates the test class and runs the suite.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script directly: `node comprehensive-working-test.js`.
3. The script will:

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes the target application is running on `localhost:8443`. Adjust `baseUrl` in the constructor if the endpoint differs.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless browser mode (`--headless: 'new'`) may not work in all environments. Ensure the target system supports Puppeteer’s headless execution.
