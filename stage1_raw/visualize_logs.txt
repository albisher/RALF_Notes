### SUMMARY
Visualizes LiDAR log data with drone waypoints and object positions using Matplotlib.

### DETAILS
This script loads predefined log data (object positions and labels) alongside a drone’s waypoint path, plotting them on a 2D coordinate plane. The `ground_truth` array contains objects (e.g., "Cube," "Sphere") with XY coordinates, while `waypoints` defines the drone’s trajectory. The visualization uses scatter plots for objects (distinguished by shape/marker) and a red dashed line for the path, with grid and legend for clarity.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`plt.scatter()`**: Renders object positions with custom markers (squares for "Cube," circles for "Sphere").
- **`zip(*waypoints)`**: Extracts X/Y coordinates from `waypoints` for plotting the drone path.
- **`plt.plot()`**: Draws the drone’s trajectory as a red dashed line with markers.

### DEPENDENCIES
matplotlib, numpy, json

### USAGE
1. Replace `ground_truth` and `waypoints` with actual log data.
2. Run the script to generate an interactive plot showing object locations and drone path.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes 2D coordinates; extend `ground_truth` with Z-values if 3D data is present.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Hardcoded waypoints may not reflect real-world mission paths. Validate against actual sensor data.
