### SUMMARY
Assessment of `ui-beta` codebase highlighting critical architectural and security issues preventing production deployment, emphasizing strict adherence to modern standards.

### DETAILS
The `ui-beta` codebase exhibits severe production-readiness deficiencies, including architectural inconsistencies between legacy and modern Vue.js implementations, security flaws like hardcoded credentials, and security misconfigurations. The assessment identifies multiple critical blockers requiring immediate resolution to ensure compliance with zero-tolerance standards for workarounds and security risks.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`js/` directory**: Legacy script-based architecture (to be eliminated).
- **`src/` directory**: Modern Vue.js/ES modules architecture (primary implementation).
- **`cardview.html`**: Legacy HTML file with CDN dependencies (needs conversion to Vue component).
- **`src/services/api-client.js`**: API client with hardcoded credentials and insecure fallback storage.
- **`src/services/auth-service.js`**: Authentication service containing hardcoded credentials.
- **`nginx.conf`**: Security misconfiguration with wildcard CORS policy.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Vue.js (legacy and modern versions), Nginx, ES modules, CDN-hosted libraries.

### USAGE
This assessment is for **internal review** to identify and resolve production blockers before deployment. Follow the required actions outlined for each issue to ensure compliance with zero-tolerance standards.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Migration
> The `js/` directory must be **completely removed** and all legacy code migrated to `src/` to avoid maintenance inconsistencies and bundle duplication.
>[!WARNING]- Security Risk
> Hardcoded credentials in `api-client.js` and `auth-service.js` pose immediate security risks if deployed to production. Replace with environment variables or user input.
>[!WARNING]- CORS Misconfiguration
> The wildcard CORS policy (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin *`) must be replaced with specific allowed origins to prevent unauthorized API access.
