### SUMMARY
Documentation for a **HMRS Window Cleaning Drone Swarm** simulation platform, covering architecture, API, and deployment.

### DETAILS
This file appears to be a **fragment** of a larger documentation file for a **Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System (HMRS)** designed for autonomous drone swarm operations, specifically for window cleaning. The content outlines the project’s purpose, technology stack, and basic deployment commands. The documentation is structured as a knowledge base for AI developers and engineers, focusing on swarm coordination, vendor compatibility, and simulation capabilities.

The provided snippet includes a **table of contents** and sections like **Project Overview**, **Quick Start Commands**, and **Technology Stack**, but lacks detailed explanations for most sections. The file is likely part of a larger documentation set for the full project.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Project Overview**: Describes the system’s goals (swarm coordination, vendor compatibility, simulation).
- **Quick Start Commands**: Provides Docker-based deployment instructions for the simulation environment.
- **Technology Stack**: Lists backend/frontend dependencies (Flask, PyBullet, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **API Reference**: (Not fully detailed in snippet; implied to be in a separate section).

### DEPENDENCIES
- Python 3.10+
- Flask (REST API)
- Socket.IO (real-time communication)
- PyBullet (physics simulation)
- PostgreSQL (session persistence)
- Docker Compose (container orchestration)
- Vue.js, Plotly.js (frontend libraries)
- Nginx (reverse proxy)

### USAGE
To use this system:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the simulation directory.
2. Run `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d` to start containers.
3. Wait for health checks (~30 seconds) and verify API endpoints (`http://localhost:5007/api/health`).
4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5007`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Project Status**
> The system is operational (8.5/10 rating) but may require updates for new drone vendors or sensor models.
>
>[!WARNING]- **Docker Dependency**
> Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running before deployment. Missing dependencies may cause container startup failures.
