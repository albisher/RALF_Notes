### SUMMARY
A simple enumeration of plant growth and health states for agricultural or botanical tracking.

### DETAILS
This file defines discrete categorical states representing different conditions of plant growth, health, and development. The states likely serve as labels for classification, monitoring, or decision-making in agricultural or horticultural applications. Each state (`healthy`, `wilted`, `dead`, etc.) corresponds to a distinct phase or condition of a plant, useful for tracking progress, diagnosing issues, or triggering interventions.

The sequence (`healthy` → `flowering` → `fruiting` → `harvested`) suggests a progression model, though the file itself does not enforce ordering—it is purely a set of labels.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
*(No functions or classes exist in this file; it is a static list.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This list is typically used as:
- Input for a classification system (e.g., machine learning model) to predict plant health or growth stage.
- A lookup table for automated systems (e.g., irrigation scheduling, pest detection) to categorize plants.
- A reference for manual or automated logging in agricultural software.

Example in code:
```python
plant_states = ["healthy", "wilted", "dead", "flowering", "fruiting", "harvested"]
current_state = "flowering"  # Assign dynamically based on observation
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Use
> These states may be extended with metadata (e.g., `age`, `water_needed`) or linked to sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature) for dynamic tracking.
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity
> Overlapping conditions (e.g., "dead" vs. "harvested") could cause misclassification if not carefully defined. Ensure distinct criteria for each state.
