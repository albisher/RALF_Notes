### SUMMARY
Validates CSS parsing warnings are resolved in a local application by testing fixes for deprecated properties and pseudo-elements.

### DETAILS
This script performs an automated test to verify CSS warning fixes in a local web application running on `localhost:8443`. It fetches the application via Axios, logs success/failure, and validates that specific CSS parsing errors (e.g., vendor prefixes, gap properties, pseudo-elements) are resolved. The test includes manual steps for browser inspection and confirms reduced warnings without breaking functionality. It logs technical changes made to `css-fixes.css`, such as replacing deprecated utilities with modern CSS alternatives.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testCSSWarningsFixed()**: Executes the automated test suite for CSS parsing warnings, logging results and expected fixes.
- **Axios GET request**: Fetches the application endpoint with a relaxed HTTPS validation (for local testing).

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `node:https` (for HTTPS agent configuration)

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a Node.js environment.
2. Ensure the application is running on `localhost:8443`.
3. The script logs test outcomes and expected fixes; manually verify browser console for reduced warnings.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This test assumes the application is deployed locally at `https://localhost:8443`. For production, adjust the endpoint URL accordingly.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Disabling HTTPS validation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) is only for local testing. In production, enforce proper certificate validation to avoid security risks.
