### SUMMARY
Verification report documenting UI/UX fixes for critical timeline navigation and world type dropdown issues in a web application, ensuring full functionality and performance improvements.

### DETAILS
This document details the resolution and verification of two critical UI/UX issues in a web application. The first fix addressed broken timeline stage navigation via URL, ensuring deep linking and bookmarking functionality worked correctly. The second fix resolved a WebSocket timeout in the world type dropdown, improving user interaction speed and preventing UI unresponsiveness. Both fixes were implemented in Vue.js components and verified through manual testing and visual confirmation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **handleHashChange**: Modified to support both URL formats (`#timeline` and `#/timeline`) in `WorkflowPage.vue`.
- **onWorldTypeChange**: Updated to use `$nextTick` for non-blocking execution in `CreateWorldModal.vue`, preventing WebSocket timeouts.
- **Timeline Stage Navigation**: Functionality restored via URL-based routing.
- **World Type Dropdown**: Dynamic UI updates and validation now execute instantly.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (for Vue components), WebSocket library (for WebSocket interactions), React Router (for URL navigation handling).

### USAGE
To apply these fixes:
1. Navigate to the specified files (`ui-beta/src/pages/WorkflowPage.vue` and `ui-beta/src/components/common/CreateWorldModal.vue`).
2. Implement the provided code snippets for `handleHashChange` and `onWorldTypeChange`.
3. Test the fixes by accessing the timeline via URL and interacting with the dropdown menu.
4. Verify no timeouts or broken navigation occur.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fixes ensure backward compatibility with existing URL structures and prevent breaking changes to existing functionality. The `$nextTick` usage in `CreateWorldModal.vue` avoids blocking the main thread, improving performance without disrupting existing workflows.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure WebSocket connections are properly managed in production to avoid similar timeout issues during dynamic UI updates. Test edge cases (e.g., rapid dropdown selections) to confirm consistent performance.
