### SUMMARY
Fixes character edit form to pre-populate with existing data for seamless editing workflows.

### DETAILS
This fix ensures character edit forms load and display existing data from either the `charactersStore` or `elementsStore`, preventing blank fields and improving UX by allowing targeted edits. The implementation handles nested data structures and multiple data formats, ensuring robustness across different character data sources.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`loadCharacter`**: Asynchronously retrieves character data from either `charactersStore` or `elementsStore` with fallback logic.
- **`startEditing`**: Populates the edit form with existing character data, converting nested objects to JSON strings for editing compatibility.
- **`editingData.value`**: Stores the pre-populated form data for editing, including fallback values for missing properties.

### DEPENDENCIES
`charactersStore`, `elementsStore`, Vue.js (for reactivity), Vue Router (for route parameter handling), Axios/HTTP client (for fetching data).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to a character detail page (e.g., `/characters/{id}`).
2. Click the edit button to trigger `startEditing()`, which populates the form with existing character data.
3. Edit fields as needed and save changes. The form retains existing data to prevent accidental loss.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Debug Logging
> Debug logs (`console.log`) are included in `loadCharacter` and `startEditing` to verify data flow and ensure correct data sources are accessed.
>[!WARNING]- Data Loss Risk Mitigation
> While the fix prevents blank forms, ensure the backend validation preserves all critical character data during save operations to avoid unintended data loss.
