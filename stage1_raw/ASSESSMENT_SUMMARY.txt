### SUMMARY
Code assessment highlights monolithic component issues requiring structural refactoring for maintainability and scalability.

### DETAILS
This assessment evaluates two large Vue components (`WorkflowPage.vue` and `CardViewPage.vue`) marked for refactoring due to excessive line counts (2,693 and 940 lines, respectively). The primary issues include:
- **Unmanageable size** violating best practices (<500 lines per component).
- **Direct API calls** (7 violations) bypassing a designed `WorldsAPIBox` layer.
- **Schema/dependency mismatches** in `MapRenderBox` requiring input validation fixes.
- **Lack of modular extraction** for critical logic (e.g., coordinate calculations, filtering).

The assessment recommends breaking components into smaller, reusable **components/composables/boxes** (e.g., `WorkflowStageSelector`, `TimelineMapBar`) while centralizing business logic in dedicated boxes. The OOP design (27 classes) and box architecture (17 boxes) are noted as strengths but are undermined by monolithic structure.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **WorkflowPage.vue**: Monolithic UI container for workflow management (needs decomposition).
- **CardViewPage.vue**: Card-based data visualization (needs modularization).
- **MapRenderBox**: Renders map data; schema validation failure blocks functionality.
- **WorldsAPIBox**: Designed API wrapper (currently bypassed in 7 direct calls).
- **Box class**: Base OOP class for all UI components (27 subclasses exist).

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js, Composition API, `WorldsAPI` service layer (unused in direct API calls), `Box` class hierarchy.

### USAGE
**Refactoring Strategy**:
1. Extract top-level UI elements (e.g., `WorldSelector`) as standalone components.
2. Replace direct API calls with `WorldsAPIBox` calls.
3. Move logic-heavy operations (e.g., filtering, coordinate math) into dedicated boxes.
4. Validate `MapRenderBox` schema to resolve containerId dependency.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Workflow
> **MapRenderBox Schema Issue**: Fixing `inputSchema` validation is non-negotiable—it halts map rendering until resolved.
>[!WARNING]- API Integration Risk
> Direct API calls bypass the designed `WorldsAPIBox` layer, risking inconsistency and violating architectural patterns. Replace all 7 violations immediately.
