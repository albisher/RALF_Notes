### SUMMARY
Describes key components and features of submersible vehicles for underwater functionality.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the functional components of submersibles, focusing on propulsion, maneuverability, and operational adaptability. The listed elements—propellers, thrusters, jet propulsion, fins, retractable propellers, ballast systems, and modular propellers—are critical for efficiency, agility, and stealth in underwater environments.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Propellers**: Provide efficient thrust for forward movement.
- **Thrusters**: Enable agile lateral and directional adjustments.
- **Jet Propulsion System**: Facilitates high-speed movement via high-velocity water ejection.
- **Fins**: Offer precise directional control and stability.
- **Retractable Propellers**: Enhance stealth by reducing noise and drag when not in use.
- **Ballast System**: Allows depth regulation via weight adjustment.
- **Modular Propellers**: Enable adaptability for different operational tasks.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (conceptual/descriptive document)

### USAGE
This document serves as a reference for engineers, designers, or researchers developing or evaluating submersible systems. It highlights trade-offs between performance, stealth, and adaptability in underwater applications.

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Trade-off
> Balancing propulsion efficiency (e.g., fixed propellers) with stealth (e.g., retractable systems) requires careful engineering trade-offs.
>[!WARNING]- Environmental Impact
> High-speed jet propulsion may generate noise or turbulence, affecting marine ecosystems—consideration for acoustic design is critical.
