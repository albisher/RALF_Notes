### SUMMARY
Script validates time-based data integrity in drone simulations by tracking positional, log, and motion changes across simulation timelines.

### DETAILS
This script (`verify_time_based_data.py`) validates whether drone positions, logs, and motion histories evolve meaningfully over time in a simulation environment. It samples data at regular intervals, storing snapshots of drone states (position, velocity, battery) alongside communication logs and trajectory histories. The script then analyzes these snapshots to confirm temporal progression, ensuring positions, logs, and motion histories grow dynamically.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`create_session()`**: Initializes simulation with buildings and drones at base positions.
- **`start_simulation()`**: Runs the simulation for a configurable duration while tracking real-time data.
- **`track_data_over_time()`**: Samples and stores snapshots at predefined intervals, capturing:
  - `sim_time` (simulation timestamp)
  - Drone positions, states, and motion histories
  - Communication logs (messages with timestamps)
- **`show_drone_activity()`**: Displays drone behavior at key time points (start, midpoint, end) via:
  - Position/state snapshots
  - Filtered communication logs
  - Motion history trajectories
- **`analyze_time_based_changes()`**: Validates temporal consistency by:
  - Verifying position/state drift over time
  - Counting unique messages and total distance traveled
  - Confirming log/motion history growth

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation` package (internal), Python 3.x (for script execution), likely external drone simulation engine (e.g., PX4, ArduPilot, or custom framework).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to the `simulation` directory:
   ```bash
   cd simulation
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 verify_time_based_data.py
   ```
3. Output includes:
   - Real-time tracking logs
   - Time-based snapshots of drone activity
   - Verification of temporal progression (pass/fail).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Dependency
> The script assumes the simulation engine advances `sim_time` incrementally. If `sim_time` remains static (e.g., stuck at 0.0s), positional changes will not be detected, invalidating all time-based validation.
>[!WARNING]- Simulation State Reset
> Resetting the simulation state may disrupt pre-existing motion histories or communication logs. Ensure data integrity before resetting if snapshots are critical for analysis.
