### SUMMARY
A lightweight rate limiter for enforcing API call constraints via timestamps.

### DETAILS
This `RateLimiterBox` class implements a sliding-window rate limiter by tracking timestamps of recent API calls. It enforces a maximum call limit (`max_calls`) within a configurable time window (`time_window`). When a call is made, the system checks if it exceeds the limit by removing outdated timestamps (older than `time_window` seconds) before evaluating eligibility. The `execute()` method supports two actions: `"check"` (validates call permission) and `"get_remaining"` (queries remaining allowed calls).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__(max_calls, time_window)`**: Configures the rate limiter with call limits and time constraints.
- **`execute(input_data)`**: Processes API call requests, enforces limits, and returns permission status/remaining calls.
  - Uses `BoxInput`/`BoxOutput` for structured data exchange with parent systems.
- **`self.calls`**: Internal list storing timestamps of recent calls (auto-cleans old entries).

### DEPENDENCIES
`time`, `logging`, `..core.box_interface` (parent Box class), `BoxInput`, `BoxOutput`.

### USAGE
1. Initialize with `RateLimiterBox(max_calls=10, time_window=60)`.
2. Call `execute()` with:
   - `"check"` action + `record_call=True` to enforce limits.
   - `"get_remaining"` action to query remaining allowed calls.
3. Example input:
   ```python
   input_data = BoxInput({"action": "check", "record_call": True})
   ```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Sliding-Window Logic
> The system dynamically adjusts call eligibility by truncating timestamps older than `time_window` seconds, ensuring fairness across bursts.
>[!WARNING]- Edge Case Handling
> If `max_calls` is exceeded, `record_call=True` has no effect—call timestamps are ignored until the window resets.
