### SUMMARY
Implements a SQLAlchemy-based audit logging system for tracking world element modifications via JSONB diff storage and event listeners.

### DETAILS
This task outlines the creation of an `AuditLog` SQLAlchemy model to record all CRUD operations on world elements. The system uses SQLAlchemy event listeners to automatically log changes, capturing before/after states via JSONB fields. The design emphasizes real-time tracking of user actions, timestamps, and detailed diffs for forensic and compliance purposes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **AuditLog SQLAlchemy Model**: Tracks element modifications with `element_id`, `user_id`, `timestamp`, `action`, and `changes` (JSONB).
- **Event Listeners**: Triggers log entries for `before_insert`, `before_update`, and `before_delete` operations.
- **Diff Computation**: Extracts changed fields between old/new states and serializes them as JSON.
- **Test Verification**: Validates audit logs via CRUD operations and assertions on `audit_logs` table.

### DEPENDENCIES
SQLAlchemy ORM, PostgreSQL (for JSONB support), Flask/FastAPI (if API layer exists), world_element models (foreign keys).

### USAGE
1. Define `AuditLog` model with `JSONB` for `changes`.
2. Attach event listeners to world_element models (e.g., `before_update`).
3. Execute CRUD operations; logs auto-populate with diffs.
4. Query `audit_logs` to inspect changes (e.g., `SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE element_id = ?`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- JSONB Limitation
> JSONB may not handle nested objects perfectly; consider custom diff logic for complex structures.
>[!WARNING]- Event Ordering
> Ensure `before_update`/`before_delete` runs before `after_update` to avoid race conditions in diff computation.
