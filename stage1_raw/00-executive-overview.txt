### SUMMARY
Provides a high-level overview of a drone-based system supporting vertical-surface window cleaning robots.

### DETAILS
This document serves as an executive summary for a **three-drone heterogeneous aerial support ecosystem**, designed to enhance the capabilities of a vertical-surface window-cleaning robot ("The Climber"). It addresses key operational challenges—such as restricted perception, logistics bottlenecks, and quality control—by integrating specialized drones (Scout, Tanker, Overseer) in a coordinated manner. The system is verified with current open-source alternatives and is production-ready, with detailed specifications for components like communication, safety protocols, and workflows.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **THE SCOUT**: Pre-computation and dynamic mapping of cleaning routes.
- **THE TANKER**: Aerial logistics and resupply of cleaning materials.
- **THE OVERSEER**: Quality assurance and safety monitoring.
- **Communication Protocol**: Enables inter-drone and robot communication.
- **Coordination & Autonomy**: Manages drone-robot synchronization.
- **Risk Analysis & Fail-Safes**: Ensures system reliability and safety compliance.
- **Operational Workflow**: Defines task sequencing and mission execution.
- **System Integration**: Bridges hardware/software components into a unified system.

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed (relies on open-source alternatives and modular components).

### USAGE
This document is a **reference for stakeholders** (engineers, project managers) outlining system architecture, dependencies, and best practices. It guides implementation of the three-drone ecosystem and cross-system components (e.g., communication, safety).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Innovation
> The system leverages **heterogeneous drones** (Scout, Tanker, Overseer) to address complementary challenges (mapping, logistics, inspection) in a modular, scalable architecture.
>[!WARNING]- Regulatory Compliance
> Ensure adherence to **2024–2025 drone regulations** (e.g., FAA/EASA standards) as referenced in [10-regulatory/](./10-regulatory/). Non-compliance risks operational shutdowns or legal penalties.
