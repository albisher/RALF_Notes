### SUMMARY
Tool to identify JavaScript functions using `await` without being marked as `async`.

### DETAILS
This script reads `app-data.js`, parses its lines, and detects functions that call `await` but lack the `async` keyword. It tracks function definitions, checks for `await` usage, and records issues in an array. The script logs mismatched functions with their line numbers for correction.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`fix_async_functions`**: Main script logic to scan and report async function issues.
  - Uses `fs.readFileSync` to load file content.
  - Splits content into lines for line-by-line analysis.
  - Tracks function definitions (non-`async`) and `await` occurrences.
  - Logs mismatched functions to `issues` array.

### DEPENDENCIES
`fs` (Node.js built-in module)

### USAGE
1. Save the script as `fix_async_functions.js`.
2. Run with Node.js: `node fix_async_functions.js`.
3. Check `console.log` output for functions needing `async` keyword.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes `app-data.js` exists in the working directory. If the file is missing, the script will fail silently (no error thrown).
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Only reports `await` usage in non-`async` functions. False positives may occur if `await` is inside comments (`//`).
