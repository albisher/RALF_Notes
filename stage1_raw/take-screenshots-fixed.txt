### SUMMARY
Automates capturing full-page screenshots of a fixed application state using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a headless Chrome browser, navigate to a local web application (`http://localhost:3001`), and systematically capture screenshots of predefined pages (`dashboard`, `timeline`, `characters`, `elements`). It includes error handling and logging for debugging. The screenshots are saved as `fixed-initial-state.png` and `fixed-{pageName}.png`.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **takeScreenshotsFixed**: Orchestrates the entire screenshot capture process, including browser initialization, navigation, and cleanup.
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to each specified URL with a delay to ensure page content loads.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures full-page screenshots at each step.
- **browser.close()**: Ensures browser resources are released after completion.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node take-screenshots-fixed.js`.
3. Ensure the target application (`http://localhost:3001`) is running before execution.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` for security, which may not work in restricted environments (e.g., Docker without proper permissions).
> Ensure the target application is fully loaded before screenshots are taken to avoid partial captures.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless mode (`headless: true`) may not work in all environments. If Puppeteer fails silently, check logs for errors like `Failed to launch browser`.
