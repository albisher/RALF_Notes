### SUMMARY
Documentation summarizing the verification of OSM-Plotly synchronization, including UI fixes and functional checks for browser compatibility.

### DETAILS
This document records the completion verification of OSM (OpenStreetMap) and Plotly synchronization in a GIS application. It details the successful resolution of UI issues, such as error handling improvements in the GPS preset dropdown and functional OSM integration with Cesium viewers. The verification includes successful initialization of Overpass API responses, proper view toggling between OSM and Plotly layouts, and correct camera resets. However, it also highlights a remaining issue where GPS coordinates do not update to the expected preset location, causing misaligned OSM building data.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **GPS Preset Dropdown**: Error handling and dropdown functionality improvements.
- **OSM Integration**: Overpass API response handling and Cesium viewer initialization.
- **View Synchronization**: Switching between OSM and Plotly views with correct layout and camera reset.
- **OSM Toggle Button**: Functionality to enable/disable OSM view and update UI state.
- **Cesium Viewers**: Initialization and configuration of 2D and 3D Cesium viewers for OSM map rendering.
- **OSM Buildings Loading**: Fetching and displaying buildings from Overpass API fallback.

### DEPENDENCIES
Cesium, Overpass API, Plotly.js, Vue.js, Browser MCP Tools, Socket.IO, WebGL Extensions

### USAGE
This document is intended for developers and QA teams to verify the functionality of OSM-Plotly synchronization in a GIS application. It provides a checklist for UI and backend components, console logs for debugging, and notes on remaining issues for further investigation.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The verification confirms that the OSM integration and view synchronization components are fully functional, but the GPS coordinates remain at a random location (`44.1253970, -146.97008`) instead of the expected preset (`29.234431, 48.054987`), causing misalignment of loaded OSM buildings.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure that the GPS coordinates are correctly updated to the preset location before final deployment to avoid incorrect visualization of OSM data in the application. This may require adjustments in the synchronization logic or preset handling code.
