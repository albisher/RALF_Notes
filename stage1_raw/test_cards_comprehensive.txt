### SUMMARY
Comprehensive automated test script for validating card lifecycle operations in a backend API, including creation, editing, deletion, and world isolation.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing of card-related operations within a backend API by:
1. Logging into the system to obtain authentication tokens
2. Retrieving world IDs for predefined test environments
3. Creating multiple card instances with varied attributes across different card types
4. Validating subsequent operations like updates and deletions
5. Generating over 100 test cards to thoroughly exercise the system

The test script follows a structured approach to verify all major card lifecycle functions while maintaining isolation between test worlds.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **CardTester.login()**: Authenticates user and retrieves authentication token.
- **CardTester.get_world_id()**: Fetches and caches world IDs by name.
- **CardTester.create_card()**: Creates new card instances with configurable parameters.
- **CardTester.update_card()**: Modifies existing card attributes.
- **CardTester.delete_card()**: Removes cards from the system.
- **CardTester.get_cards()**: Retrieves all cards for a specific world.
- **CardTester.test_card_creation()**: Orchestrates the comprehensive card creation test.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, json, random, datetime, sys, os

### USAGE
1. Place script in directory containing backend module
2. Configure BASE_URL to match backend server address
3. Set TEST_USERNAME/PASSWORD to valid credentials
4. Run script to execute all test procedures
5. Verify output messages for test results and failures

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses random values for attributes (color, size, power) to ensure varied test cases. This helps identify edge cases in attribute validation.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure the backend server is running at localhost:5000 before executing. The script will fail if the API endpoints are unavailable. Test credentials must match backend authentication requirements exactly.
