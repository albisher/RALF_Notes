### SUMMARY
Document defines architectural requirements for a drone system, covering OOP design, building management, and drone components like motors, battery, and weight management.

### DETAILS
This document specifies the architectural blueprint for the **HMRS drone system**, emphasizing object-oriented principles, modular addon systems, and hierarchical organizational structures. It details core drone components (motors, battery, weight management) and their interdependencies, alongside building management features like spawning/deleting buildings in a simulation environment. The design ensures dynamic weight tracking, lift capacity calculations, and safety margins while allowing configurable drone configurations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Building Spawn Control**: Spawns/deletes random buildings with spatial constraints.
- **Dynamic Addons System**: Modular components (e.g., sensors, batteries) with weight/performance variables.
- **Weight Management**: Tracks base weight, addons, payload, and total weight for flight stability.
- **Lift Capacity Calculation**: Computes max lift based on motor/battery/environmental factors.
- **Battery Dependency**: Models real-time consumption tied to motor usage and flight conditions.

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed (conceptual design; may rely on simulation frameworks like Unity/Unreal for visualization).

### USAGE
1. **For Developers**: Implement drone components (motors, battery) with configurable parameters.
2. **For Simulation**: Use building spawn/deletion controls in the UI panel.
3. **For Testing**: Validate weight/weight distribution logic under varied payloads.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Design Choice
> Motor rotation direction must be **consistently defined** (e.g., all clockwise/counter-clockwise) to avoid flight instability during dynamic addon swaps.
>[!WARNING]- Safety Margin
> The 20-30% reserve in lift capacity is non-negotiable—exceeding it risks catastrophic failure. Always validate calculations during testing.
