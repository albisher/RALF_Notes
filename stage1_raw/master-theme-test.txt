### SUMMARY
Tests and validates a master theme implementation for a frontend application using Vuetify and Tailwind CSS in a containerized environment.

### DETAILS
This script verifies the consistency and correctness of a themed application by checking its response to a local API endpoint and logging predefined color schemes for both light and dark modes. It ensures the application adheres to a predefined `colors.txt` palette, integrates Vuetify and Tailwind CSS themes, and confirms proper containerization (Docker-based) without local development servers. The test includes manual steps for visual verification of theme behavior.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testMasterTheme()**: Executes automated checks for theme implementation, logs responses, and validates color consistency across light/dark modes.
- **axios.get()**: Fetches the application endpoint to confirm it loads successfully (with HTTPS agent bypass for local testing).

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, `require('axios')`, `require('https')`

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a Node.js environment with Docker containers preconfigured.
2. The script logs test results and expected behavior, requiring manual verification of UI components.
3. Ensure `colors.txt` exists and matches the predefined palette for accurate theme validation.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes Docker containers are running (frontend: Vite on 5173, backend: Flask on 5000, Nginx on 8443). Local Node.js servers must be disabled to avoid conflicts.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> HTTPS agent bypass (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) is used for local testing only. In production, enforce proper SSL validation.
