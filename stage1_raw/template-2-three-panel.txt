### SUMMARY
A modular three-panel layout for a power-user-focused digital workspace, optimizing simultaneous access to tools via dynamic content switching.

### DETAILS
This template organizes a workspace into three vertically stacked panels (left, center, right) with configurable widths, enabling real-time synchronization across tools. The **left panel** manages metadata (worlds, filters, assets), the **center panel** displays content in one of four modes (grid, timeline, hash generation, or builder), and the **right panel** provides detailed views or tools. Responsive breakpoints adjust panel visibility, and drag-and-drop interactions allow cross-panel content transfer. The design prioritizes state preservation and minimizes navigation overhead.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **World List**: Displays and manages all worlds with a create button.
- **Card Grid Mode**: Renders cards in a responsive 2–4 column layout with infinite scroll/pagination.
- **Timeline View Mode**: Shows cards chronologically with zoom/navigation controls.
- **Hash Generation Mode**: Inputs prompts to generate hashes with preview tabs.
- **Card Builder Mode**: Edits cards via a form and preview section.
- **Card Detail Panel**: Displays full card metadata, images, and edit/delete buttons.
- **Image Generator (IGD)**: Handles AI-generated image prompts and previews.
- **Filters (CF)**: Applies card type/time/tag filters dynamically.
- **Asset Library**: Manages liked hashes and recent cards.
- **Mode Switcher**: Toggles between center panel modes via tabs or dropdown.

### DEPENDENCIES
Obsidian core (for card-based workflows), custom UI libraries (e.g., CSS Grid/Flexbox), and optional plugins for drag-and-drop (e.g., Obsidian’s native drag-and-drop).

### USAGE
1. **Initial Setup**: Configure panel widths (e.g., 280px left, 400px center, 320px right).
2. **Mode Switching**: Use tabs/dropdowns to change center panel content (e.g., switch from grid to timeline).
3. **Filtering**: Apply filters in the left panel to update the center panel dynamically.
4. **Resizing**: Drag handles between panels to adjust sizes (respecting min/max constraints).
5. **Cross-Panel Actions**: Select a card in the grid to auto-populate the right panel’s detail view.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **State Synchronization**
> All panels update in real-time when filters/worlds are modified, ensuring context consistency across tools.
>[!WARNING]- **Beginner Overload**
> The dense layout may overwhelm users unfamiliar with multi-panel workflows; consider adding a "simplified mode" for new users.
>[!INFO]- **Responsive Prioritization**
> Mobile breakpoints collapse panels into modals/drawers, but critical actions (e.g., card selection) remain accessible via swipe gestures.
