### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Domain randomization significantly enhances generalization in robotic control systems by exposing models to varied physics, sensor noise, and environments, reducing overfitting to simulation-specific conditions.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> While Gazebo and MuJoCo offer high accuracy, their computational overhead may limit real-time applicability; PyBullet provides a balance of speed and accuracy for many robotic tasks. Always validate simulator outputs against real-world data.
