### SUMMARY
Summary of CLI-driven task updates for a space world-building application, detailing procedural generation, visualization, and data integration across existing codebase tasks.

### DETAILS
This document summarizes CLI-based updates to a task management system for a space world-building application. The CLI (`task-master`) was used to analyze and integrate existing procedural generation, 2D/3D visualizations, and data export systems into a structured workflow. The updates were batch-processed across 50 tasks, focusing on integrating pre-existing components (e.g., `Generators/`, `app/map.js`, `app/globe.js`) into a Vue-based architecture. The process prioritized existing functionality over new development, ensuring compatibility with existing code structures like Three.js, D3.js, and Pinia state management.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`task-master update`**: Batch-processes task updates across specified ranges (e.g., `--from=8`).
- **`task-master set-status`**: Marks subtasks as "done" or tracks progress (e.g., Task 8.3, Task 12.1).
- **Research directory**: Contains code analysis findings (e.g., `code/` folder) for implementation guidance.
- **Docker environment setup**: High-priority Task 1 for containerization.
- **Database migrations**: Task 2 for schema integration.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js, Three.js, D3.js, Flask (for API endpoints), Pinia (state management), Docker, existing procedural generation libraries, and world-building data formats (e.g., JSON/CSV for exports).

### USAGE
1. **Execute CLI commands** to update tasks (e.g., `task-master update --from=12`).
2. **Follow task dependencies** (e.g., Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3) for systematic implementation.
3. **Use research files** (e.g., `.taskmaster/research/code/`) to guide integration of existing components.
4. **Track progress** via `task-master set-status` for subtasks (e.g., "done" statuses).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The CLI updates assume existing code (e.g., `app/map.js`, `app/globe.js`) is already developed. Directly wrap these in Vue components (e.g., `<MapView />`) to avoid duplication.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Prioritize Task 1 (Docker setup) and Task 2 (Database) before integrating visualizations/data exports. Incomplete migrations or environment setup may break existing code dependencies.
