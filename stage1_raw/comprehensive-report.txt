### SUMMARY
A detailed status report on the Space Pearl World Builder system, covering authentication, database functionality, API endpoints, and frontend integration, with plans for future expansion.

### DETAILS
This report documents the current state of the **Space Pearl World Builder**, a system designed to create and manage immersive virtual worlds with AI-generated elements, historical documentation, and spatial data. The system includes a functional **authentication system** (JWT-based) and **database backend** (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage of worlds, characters, and elements. Key APIs handle world creation, element generation, and data retrieval, while the frontend integrates dynamic visualizations like dashboards, timelines, and character profiles. The report also highlights **documentation integration**, including historical events, character backstories, and environmental data, ready for implementation in future systems. Future features include **AI-powered plant and technology generation**, interactive **world maps**, and **3D globe visualizations**, with export capabilities for structured data.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Authentication System**: Manages user login, JWT token handling, and route protection.
- **World Creation API**: Creates and stores new worlds in the database with metadata.
- **Element Generation API**: Uses AI to generate characters, plants, or technology based on provided seeds.
- **Database Layer**: Handles PostgreSQL storage for worlds, elements, and user data.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Displays real-time statistics and interactive visualizations.
- **Timeline & Characters UI**: Displays historical events and character profiles with Arabic names.
- **Taskmaster Integration**: Manages project tasks via MCP configurations.

### DEPENDENCIES
PostgreSQL, Node.js (for backend APIs), React/Next.js (for frontend), JWT libraries, AI service (for element generation), Obsidian/Markdown (for documentation files).

### USAGE
1. **Backend Setup**: Deploy the API endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/login`, etc.) with JWT authentication.
2. **Database**: Configure PostgreSQL to store worlds, elements, and user data.
3. **Frontend Integration**: Connect frontend components (dashboard, timeline, map) to backend APIs.
4. **Documentation**: Load pre-existing files (e.g., `plants001.txt`, `technology001.txt`) into the system.
5. **Future Features**: Implement AI services for plant/technology generation and UI components for maps/globe visualizations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The **AI element generation** (e.g., characters, plants) relies on pre-loaded documentation files. Ensure all `.txt` files (e.g., `plants001.txt`) are correctly parsed before generation.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The **JWT token system** requires secure storage of tokens. Avoid hardcoding credentials in client-side code; use environment variables or secure backend storage.
