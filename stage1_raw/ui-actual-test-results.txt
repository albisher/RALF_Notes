### SUMMARY
Documentation of actual browser testing results for a Vue.js-based UI application, detailing errors, fixes, and functional components.

### DETAILS
This document records findings from browser testing of a Vue.js application deployed on `http://localhost:5007`. It includes critical errors (e.g., missing props in `detailsModal` and `confirmationDialog`), warnings (e.g., Vue dev build usage), and confirmed working components (e.g., API endpoints, Socket.IO, WebGL). The report outlines fixes applied (safe property access, `v-if` checks) and remaining unresolved issues (component registration order, UI rendering). The next steps involve refreshing the browser, testing tabs/features, and verifying visibility of components.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **API Health Endpoint (`/api/health`)**: Returns status `{"status": "ok"}`.
- **API State Endpoint (`/api/state`)**: Returns valid data.
- **Socket.IO Connection**: Establishes successful connection.
- **WebGL Extensions Box**: Initializes successfully.
- **`detailsModal`**: Previously failed due to missing prop; fixed with `v-if` and safe access.
- **`confirmationDialog`**: Previously failed due to undefined state; fixed similarly.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (development build), Socket.IO, WebGL extensions, browser tools (Chrome).

### USAGE
Review this document to track UI testing progress, apply fixes, and validate component functionality. Use the next steps to systematically test resolved issues and confirm UI rendering.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The Vue development build is being used, but production builds (`*.prod.js`) should be deployed for production to avoid warnings.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Component registration order may still cause rendering issues; verify dependencies after fixes.
