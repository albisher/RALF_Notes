### SUMMARY
Documentation of HMRS simulation system performance metrics, including API response times, simulation configuration, and system architecture.

### DETAILS
This report evaluates the performance of the HMRS simulation system, focusing on API response times, simulation timesteps, and real-time visualization. It highlights that API endpoints are highly responsive (average < 10ms), while simulation performance depends on Docker for accurate testing. Key metrics include a 240 Hz physics timestep, frame caching, and background thread management for smooth operation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`hmrs_simulation_live.py`**: Main simulation controller with Flask web server and real-time physics at 240 Hz.
- **`simulation/test_performance.py`**: Benchmarking script for initialization speed, step performance, and API response times.
- **Docker container (`hmrs-live-simulation`)**: Isolated environment with PyBullet, NumPy, and Matplotlib for simulation dependencies.

### DEPENDENCIES
PyBullet, NumPy, Matplotlib, Flask, Docker (for full testing environment).

### USAGE
To test performance:
1. Run the simulation in a Docker container.
2. Execute `simulation/test_performance.py` for benchmarking.
3. Monitor API endpoints (`/api/state`, `/api/data`) for real-time responsiveness.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
>API response times are measured in a non-Docker environment and may vary in production due to system overhead. Docker ensures consistent testing.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
>Simulation performance degrades if the Docker container lacks sufficient CPU/RAM. Ensure resources meet 240 Hz requirements (e.g., 4+ cores, 8GB+ RAM).
