### SUMMARY
Defines categorical labels for branch density classifications in ecological or biological studies.

### DETAILS
This appears to be a simple classification system categorizing branch density into four discrete levels: **dying**, **normal**, **dense**, and **very dense**. These labels likely represent qualitative observations of branch health or structural density in a biological or environmental context (e.g., tree branches, coral reefs, or vascular plants). The labels are likely used for data annotation, analysis, or classification in studies assessing growth, survival, or ecosystem health.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Label Assignment**: Assigns qualitative density classifications to observed branches.
- **Data Categorization**: Structures observations into predefined density categories for analysis.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This classification system is typically used in:
- Field studies to document branch health/density visually.
- Machine learning or image analysis pipelines where these labels are input features.
- Reporting or research documentation to standardize observations across studies.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Use
> These labels may correspond to specific thresholds or visual cues (e.g., "very dense" = >80% branch coverage, "dying" = brown/necrotic tissue). Clarify thresholds if used in quantitative studies.
>[!WARNING]- Subjectivity
> Qualitative labels like these can vary by observer. Standardize training criteria to minimize bias in classification.
