### TYPE

### SUMMARY
Defines fruit types found in tundra biomes, categorizing them into berries, nuts, and absence of fruit.

### DETAILS
This file outlines the possible fruit types that could exist in tundra ecosystems, emphasizing the scarcity of edible plant matter due to harsh climatic conditions. The classification includes **berries** (both clustered and singular forms) and **nuts** (distinguished by shell hardness), alongside a placeholder for cases where no fruit is present. This reflects the limited biodiversity and resource availability typical of tundra environments.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Fruit Categorization**: Defines structured categories for tundra fruit types (berries, nuts, none).
- **Ecological Adaptation**: Serves as a reference for plant adaptations in cold climates.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This document is likely used in ecological modeling, game design (e.g., survival mechanics), or environmental studies to represent food sources in tundra biomes. It can be referenced in systems requiring biome-specific plant data.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Ecological Context
> Tundra biomes typically lack diverse fruit-bearing plants due to short growing seasons and permafrost, making this a simplified categorization for modeling purposes.
>[!WARNING]- Data Limitation
> "none" indicates no fruit presence, which may require additional context (e.g., absence of edible plants) in applications.
