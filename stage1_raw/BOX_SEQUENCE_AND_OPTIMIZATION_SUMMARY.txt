### SUMMARY
Analyzes a map generation workflow and proposes optimizations for performance, modularity, and user experience.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a **map generation system** with a detailed sequence from user interaction to final map rendering. The current workflow suffers from sequential cell operations, excessive API polling, and lack of caching, leading to slow performance. The proposed optimizations restructure the system into smaller, parallelizable components, introduce caching layers, and enhance user interaction with quick preview modes. The architecture emphasizes modularity, caching, and parallel processing to improve efficiency and scalability.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **GenerateStage**: Initiates map generation workflow.
- **MapGeneratorBox**: Generates initial map parameters (seed, resolution, etc.).
- **MapGeneratorServiceBox**: Manages asynchronous job submission and polling.
- **WorldTypeTerrainGeneratorBox**: Generates terrain arrays using hash-based methods.
- **WorldTypeHeightmapGeneratorBox**: Orchestrates heightmap generation with sequential cell operations.
- **MapGeneratorPage**: Frontend component handling user inputs and rendering.
- **CellMappingBox** (new): Maps terrain coordinates to Voronoi cells.
- **HeightCalculationBox** (new): Computes height values from terrain inputs.
- **HeightVariationBox** (new): Applies hash-based variations to heights.
- **TerrainCacheBox** (new): Caches terrain generation results.
- **HeightmapCacheBox** (new): Caches heightmap results.
- **Quick Preview Mode**: Immediate heightmap rendering for user feedback.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Python backend libraries (e.g., `asyncio`, `hashlib` for hashing).
- JavaScript frontend libraries (e.g., `fetch` for API calls, `Web Workers` for parallelism).
- Existing `HashGeneratorMasterBox`, `HashBasedHeightmapUtilsBox`, and `Voronoi` algorithms.
- Database for caching (e.g., Redis, SQLite).

### USAGE
1. **User Interaction**: User inputs seed, world type, and map parameters via `MapGeneratorPage`.
2. **Quick Preview**: Frontend triggers a cached or parallelized heightmap generation, rendering immediately.
3. **Full Generation**: If user requests full map, backend processes sequentially cached/parallelized steps, then assembles biomes, cities, and final map data.
4. **Caching**: Intermediate results (terrain, heightmaps) are cached to avoid redundant computations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Sequential Bottleneck**
> Current heightmap generation runs cell-by-cell sequentially, limiting parallelism. The proposed `CellMappingBox` and parallelized `HeightCalculationBox` address this by distributing workload across threads/processes.

>[!WARNING]- **Cache Invalidation Risk**
> Caching layers (`TerrainCacheBox`, `HeightmapCacheBox`) must handle invalidation when world parameters (e.g., seed, resolution) change. Implement a cache key system that includes all relevant variables to avoid stale data.
