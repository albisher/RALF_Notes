### SUMMARY
A Vue.js component for displaying system monitoring metrics, logs, and alerts in a responsive dashboard.

### DETAILS
This component implements a Vue.js template for a **System Monitoring Page**, designed to render real-time system health metrics, status cards, and alerts. It uses a responsive grid layout to display three key health indicators (System Status, API Health, and Socket.IO Health) with gradient backgrounds and emoji icons. The component is conditionally rendered (`v-if`) based on `currentView` to ensure it only appears in the correct context. The styling is minimalist with dark-themed UI elements, ensuring visibility against a dark background.

The template includes a header with a title and subtitle, followed by a grid of status cards. Each card shows a status indicator (e.g., "Operational" or "Connected") and a descriptive message. The component leverages inline styles for simplicity but could be refactored into a CSS class system for maintainability.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`template`**: Renders the UI structure for the system monitoring dashboard.
- **`v-if="currentView === 'system-monitoring'"`: Conditionally renders the component based on a parent component’s state.
- **`health-card` divs**: Container components for individual status indicators (e.g., System Status, API Health).

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (for reactivity and conditional rendering), Vue’s `<div>` and `<style>` tags (inline).

### USAGE
To use this component:
1. Import it into a parent Vue component.
2. Set `currentView` to `'system-monitoring'` to render the component.
3. Pass data (e.g., status updates) via props if needed (not shown in snippet).
4. Embed the rendered output in a parent template.

Example:
```html
<SystemMonitoringPageComponent v-if="currentView === 'system-monitoring'" />
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Component Context
> This component assumes `currentView` is managed by a parent component (e.g., a router or state manager). Without it, the UI will not render.
>[!WARNING]- Inline Styles
> Inline styles are used for simplicity but may become unwieldy in larger projects. Consider extracting styles to a CSS file or CSS-in-JS solution for scalability.
