### SUMMARY
Document outlining technical requirements for a modular content-generation system, covering architecture, performance, and integration.

### DETAILS
This document captures technical questions and decisions regarding system architecture, content generation logic, 3D modeling, web interfaces, performance, data management, APIs, security, and deployment. It outlines trade-offs (e.g., JSON vs PostgreSQL storage) and design choices (e.g., plugin support, real-time interactions) while emphasizing modularity, scalability, and extensibility.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Modular Generator Architecture**: Maintains current modular design with dependency tracking.
- **Plugin-Based Extensions**: Supports dynamic generator extensions.
- **Database Storage**: Researches PostgreSQL as a storage solution (vs JSON files).
- **Content Generation Engine**: Balances deterministic hashing with randomness for consistency/relatedness.
- **3D Integration**: Optional Blender/other platform support for model complexity.
- **REST APIs**: Optional external integration via REST endpoints.
- **Real-Time Caching**: Implements caching for performance optimization.
- **Versioning & Backups**: Ensures data integrity and recovery.

### DEPENDENCIES
PostgreSQL (researched), Flask (web app), Docker (containerization), CI/CD tools (automated testing), monitoring tools (alerting).

### USAGE
This document serves as a reference for stakeholders to validate technical decisions during system design. Key decisions (e.g., storage, APIs) require further research or consensus before implementation.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Modularity Priority**
> Prioritize loose coupling between generators to enable independent updates and dependency resolution.
>[!WARNING]- **PostgreSQL Trade-offs**
> Researching PostgreSQL may require schema migrations; JSON files offer simplicity but lack scalability for large datasets.
>[!INFO]- **Real-Time vs Batch**
> Balancing real-time interactions (e.g., Flask) with concurrency limits (e.g., user sessions) impacts performance.
>[!WARNING]- **Security Assumptions**
> Data validation/sanitization must align with security requirements (e.g., encryption for sensitive content).
