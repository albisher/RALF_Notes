### SUMMARY
Tests drone flight simulation at a predefined home location and validates playback functionality.

### DETAILS
This script automates the process of verifying a drone flight simulation at a fixed home GPS coordinate. It checks service readiness, configures GPS coordinates, spawns a drone, and initiates a simulation to ensure the system behaves as expected. The script uses HTTP requests to interact with a local drone simulation API, with retry logic for transient failures.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **wait_for_service**: Polls the API endpoint `/api/health` to confirm the drone simulation service is operational.
- **set_gps_location**: Sets the drone’s GPS coordinates to predefined home coordinates (latitude/longitude).
- **spawn_drone**: Creates a drone instance (e.g., "Scout-001") at a specified position (x, y, z).
- **start_simulation**: Triggers the drone flight simulation from the home location.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, time, json, datetime (Python standard libraries)
External API: `http://localhost:5007` (drone simulation service)

### USAGE
1. Run the script to:
   - Wait for the drone service to start.
   - Set the drone’s GPS to home coordinates.
   - Spawn a drone and begin a simulated flight.
2. Monitor console output for success/failure messages.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the drone service runs on `localhost:5007`. Adjust `BASE_URL` if the service uses a different port or host.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Retries for service readiness may delay execution. Increase `max_retries` or `delay` if the service is slow to start.
