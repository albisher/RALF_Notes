### SUMMARY
Automated demo script for testing Space Peral’s hash-based asset generation system using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script automates interactions with a Space Peral application to verify hash-based generation features (character, plant, building, robot) by:
1. Launching a headless browser to navigate to the demo URL.
2. Handling potential login via automated form submission.
3. Navigating to the Writing Workspace and capturing screenshots.
4. Logging UI confirmation of implemented hash features (e.g., seed inputs, preview sections).
5. Tracking network/API calls and console errors for debugging.

The script validates frontend/backend integration for deterministic asset generation via hash inputs.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `createSpacePeralWorldDemo()`: Orchestrates browser launch, navigation, and screenshot capture.
- `page.on('request', ...)`: Logs API calls (e.g., `/api/` endpoints) for debugging.
- `page.evaluateHandle()`: Dynamically locates UI elements (e.g., login buttons, workspace links).
- `page.screenshot()`: Captures UI states (initial page, workspace) for verification.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime.

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run script: `node space-peral-final-demo.js`.
3. Ensure the target URL (`https://localhost:8443`) matches the deployed Space Peral demo.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the target URL is `https://localhost:8443` and uses hardcoded credentials (`test`/`passtest`). Adjust paths and credentials for production testing.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless browser flags (`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-web-security`) may break security checks in production environments. Use cautiously in non-dev contexts.
