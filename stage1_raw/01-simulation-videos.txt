### SUMMARY
Document outlining curated YouTube video sources for simulation tool demonstrations, focusing on robotics, AI, and multi-agent systems.

### DETAILS
This document serves as a research log for finding and organizing YouTube videos related to simulation tools, particularly for the HMRS project. It categorizes videos by platforms (e.g., TwoMinutePapers, PyBullet, Gazebo) and topics (e.g., physics engines, multi-robot coordination, reinforcement learning). The content includes search strategies for locating relevant videos via Perplexity MCP and direct YouTube queries. It also references related documents for broader context and action items for updating and verifying video links.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Research Strategy**: Defines search terms and platforms for finding simulation videos.
- **Topic Categorization**: Organizes videos by key themes (e.g., simulation accuracy, multi-robot systems).
- **Link Management**: Notes the need to update and verify video links dynamically.
- **Related Document Links**: Connects to broader project overviews and reviews.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Perplexity MCP (for automated video discovery via Docker setup)
- YouTube API (for direct video searches)
- Obsidian/Markdown tools (for documentation management)

### USAGE
1. Use search terms in Perplexity MCP or YouTube to find specific videos.
2. Update links and timestamps as new videos are discovered.
3. Cross-reference with related documents (e.g., `00-two-minute-papers-overview.md`) for deeper analysis.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dynamic Updates
> Video links are frequently updated; this document requires periodic review via Perplexity MCP or manual searches.
>[!WARNING]- Link Verification
> Always verify links are current before use, as YouTube URLs may change or videos may be removed.
