### **SUMMARY**
Executes automated UI verification for all webapp components using Puppeteer and Task-Master tagging system.

### **DETAILS**
This document records the completion of a full UI verification workflow for a web application, leveraging the `space-peral-ui-check` tag in Task-Master. The process involved running automated checks across eight major components (Dashboard, Worlds, Characters, Elements, Writer Workspace, World Detail, Sidebar, Asset Creator) via a custom script (`comprehensive-ui-verification.js`). Each component was validated for visibility, interactive elements, and expected behaviors, with minor issues noted (e.g., missing buttons). The verification was executed in a headless Puppeteer environment with robust error handling, logging, and screenshot capture. Task-Master was used to manage the tagged tasks, showing 4/6 completed tasks (67% progress) with subtasks fully resolved.

### **KEY_FUNCTIONS**
- **`testDashboard()`**: Validates dashboard component (stat cards, navigation).
- **`testWorlds()`**: Checks worlds component (cards, create button).
- **`testCharacters()`**: Confirms character component (cards, edit buttons).
- **`testElements()`**: Tests elements component (cards).
- **`testWorkspace()`**: Validates writer workspace (writing area, asset selectors).
- **`testWorldDetail()`**: Ensures world detail component (buttons).
- **`testSidebar()`**: Audits sidebar navigation links.
- **`testAssetCreator()`**: Checks asset creator dialog (button presence).
- **`puppeteer.launch()`**: Configures headless browser for automation.
- **`task-master use-tag space-peral-ui-check`**: Switches to UI verification context.

### **DEPENDENCIES**
Puppeteer, Node.js, Task-Master CLI, Web application backend.

### **USAGE**
1. Run `task-master use-tag space-peral-ui-check` to activate UI verification mode.
2. Execute `node checks/comprehensive-ui-verification.js` to trigger automated checks.
3. Review results in logs/screenshots (e.g., `comprehensive-*.png` files).
4. Update Task-Master status for pending tasks (e.g., Task 5: Story Creation Session).

### **CALLOUTS**
>[!INFO]- Minor Issues
> Minor UI inconsistencies (e.g., missing "Create World" button, unclickable "Add Character" button) were noted but did not block full verification.
>[!WARNING]- Headless Mode
> Puppeteer runs in headless mode (`headless: true`) to avoid visual conflicts; ensure the environment allows sandbox bypass for automation.
