### SUMMARY
Investigates why the Cesium 2D Top View fails to load OSM map tiles, resulting in a black screen despite correct initialization and crosshair visibility.

### DETAILS
The issue involves a Cesium-based 2D top-view mode that displays a black screen while the 3D isometric view works correctly. The problem stems from improper tile loading in SCENE2D mode, likely due to incorrect camera positioning, imagery provider misconfiguration, or timing delays. Debugging attempts include locked scene modes, adjusted error thresholds, and delayed camera positioning, but no solution has been found yet.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **OSMIntegrationBox**: Initializes the 2D Cesium viewer for OSM map rendering.
- **update2DTopView()**: Dynamically updates the 2D view’s imagery layers and camera settings.
- **viewRectangle()**: Attempted to set the view rectangle for tile loading (failed).
- **setView() / flyTo()**: Alternative camera positioning methods (inactive).

### DEPENDENCIES
Cesium.js, OpenStreetMapImageryProvider, Cesium 2D/3D scene modes.

### USAGE
The code is part of a GIS application using Cesium for 3D/2D map visualization. The 2D top-view mode should load OSM tiles based on camera position, but current fixes (e.g., locked scene modes) do not resolve the black screen issue.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Imagery Provider Limitation
> Cesium’s `OpenStreetMapImageryProvider` may not function correctly in SCENE2D mode, requiring alternative imagery sources or adjustments to tile loading logic.
>[!WARNING]- Timing Dependency
> Camera positioning must occur *after* imagery layers are initialized to avoid race conditions, as delays (e.g., 1000ms) were tested but failed to resolve the issue.
