### SUMMARY
Summary of complete boxing refactoring for JavaScript frontend components and app-data.js to enforce box architecture principles.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring effort to replace direct API calls (using `fetch()`) with a centralized `APICommunicationBox` wrapper across Vue.js components and `app-data.js`. The goal was to adhere to box architecture principles, ensuring components follow **Single Responsibility**, **Clear Input/Output**, **Reusability**, and **No Bypass** of the box layer. All 27 `fetch()` calls in `app-data.js` were replaced with calls to `window.apiCommunicationBox`, enforcing a structured, modular approach to API interactions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`APICommunicationBox`**: Centralized wrapper for all API calls, enforcing a single entry point for all HTTP requests.
- **`updateStatus()`**: Manages real-time status updates via the box layer.
- **`loadSessionReplay()`**: Loads session replays with fallback logic.
- **`sendCommand()`**: Handles drone or system commands through the box.

### DEPENDENCIES
`window.apiCommunicationBox` (assumed to be a globally available box instance), Vue.js components (directly updated in this refactoring).

### USAGE
To use this refactored code:
1. Replace all direct `fetch()` calls in components with calls to `window.apiCommunicationBox.get()` or `window.apiCommunicationBox.post()`.
2. Ensure `APICommunicationBox` is initialized and available globally before refactored components load.
3. Follow the box architecture pattern to maintain modularity and reusability.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Centralized Error Handling
> The refactoring assumes `APICommunicationBox` includes error handling for missing instances or API failures. Components must now handle errors through the box layer’s error propagation mechanisms.
>[!WARNING]- Global Dependency
> `window.apiCommunicationBox` must be initialized before any component or `app-data.js` functions execute to avoid runtime errors. Ensure proper initialization order in the application lifecycle.
