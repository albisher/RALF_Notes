### SUMMARY
Fixed Overpass API integration issues to enable reliable loading of 3D buildings by improving endpoint redundancy, query syntax, and error handling.

### DETAILS
This file documents comprehensive fixes for Overpass API integration, addressing critical failures in fetching 3D building data. The solution includes multiple fallback endpoints, enhanced query syntax, increased bounding box tolerance, and robust error handling to ensure network reliability and query efficiency.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`loadBuildingsFromOverpass()`**: Enhanced function in `simulation/frontend/boxes/osm-integration-box.js` that now supports multiple Overpass API endpoints with retry logic and timeout handling.
- **`fetch` with `AbortController`**: Timeout mechanism for API requests to prevent hanging.
- **Optimized Overpass Query**: Simplified and recursive query for accurate building data retrieval.

### DEPENDENCIES
`fetch` (built-in browser API), `AbortController` (modern browser API), `encodeURIComponent` (built-in), Overpass API endpoints (external).

### USAGE
To use these fixes, ensure the modified `osm-integration-box.js` is loaded in the frontend. The system will automatically retry failed API calls across multiple endpoints and handle timeouts gracefully.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The modified query now uses a recursive approach (`(._;>;)`) to ensure all building-related nodes are fetched, improving accuracy for 3D building data extraction.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure all fallback endpoints (`overpass-api.de`, `overpass.kumi.systems`, `overpass.openstreetmap.ru`) are reachable to avoid complete API failures. Test with a large bounding box to verify performance.
