### SUMMARY
Defines security measures for authentication, authorization, and compliance in a system.

### DETAILS
This file outlines a structured security implementation focusing on **authentication** (JWT tokens, OAuth2, RBAC), **authorization** (API keys, permission levels, audit logging), and **compliance** (GDPR adherence, data encryption, secure communication protocols). The design ensures secure user access, data protection, and regulatory adherence.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **JWT tokens**: Issued for stateless authentication, containing claims for user identity and permissions.
- **OAuth2 integration**: Enables delegation of user authentication to third-party providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Defines granular permission levels based on user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
- **API key management**: Securely stores and validates API keys for service-to-service communication.
- **Audit logging**: Tracks all security-relevant actions (e.g., login attempts, permission changes) for compliance and forensic analysis.
- **Data encryption**: Applies symmetric/asymmetric encryption (e.g., AES, RSA) to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Secure communication**: Enforces TLS 1.2+ for encrypted network traffic.

### DEPENDENCIES
`cryptography-libraries` (e.g., OpenSSL, PyCryptodome), `OAuth2 SDK`, `RBAC framework`, `Audit logging tools`, `GDPR compliance modules`.

### USAGE
1. **Authentication**: Implement JWT/OAuth2 middleware in web servers (e.g., Flask/Django) and validate API keys via middleware.
2. **Authorization**: Configure RBAC policies in user management systems and enforce permissions via middleware checks.
3. **Compliance**: Integrate encryption libraries (e.g., AES-256) for data at rest and enforce TLS 1.2+ for all external communications.
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all critical actions (e.g., login attempts, permission changes) to a centralized database or SIEM tool.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **JWT/OAuth2**: Ensure tokens are short-lived (e.g., 15–30 minutes) and use refresh tokens for long-term sessions to mitigate replay attacks.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **API Key Management**: Never hardcode keys in client-side code. Rotate keys periodically and revoke unused ones immediately.
