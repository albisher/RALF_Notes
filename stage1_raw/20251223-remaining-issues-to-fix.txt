### SUMMARY
Document tracking unresolved issues requiring fixes, focusing on Cesium 2D viewer initialization and HTTP command processing errors.

### DETAILS
This document lists unresolved issues from a technical analysis, specifically highlighting critical and high-priority fixes that have been implemented but require manual testing. The issues include failures in Cesium 2D viewer initialization due to conditional rendering and state mismatches, and HTTP 500 errors during backend command execution. Root causes involve timing, layout mode checks, and error handling for command processing.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`cesium-2d-top-viewer` initialization**: Conditional rendering and state validation logic in `simulation/frontend/boxes/osm-integration-box.js` and `simulation/frontend/app-data.js`.
- **`drone.receive_command()`**: Command processing wrapper with error handling in backend code.
- **Vue watcher**: Component in `visualization-view-component.js` for reactive state management.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Cesium library, Vue.js framework, backend HTTP server, drone command processing module.

### USAGE
This document is for developers to verify fixes by testing the Cesium 2D viewer initialization and command processing error handling in the frontend/backend systems.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fixes for Cesium 2D viewer initialization include state validation (`osmViewEnabled`, `layoutMode`) and container existence checks to prevent initialization failures. Manual testing is required to confirm the viewer renders correctly in valid states.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Command processing errors are now logged but do not fail the HTTP request, ensuring the command remains queued for later processing. Ensure the simulation loop correctly handles queued commands with failed processing.
