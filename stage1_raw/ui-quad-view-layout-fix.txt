### SUMMARY
Fixed the quad view layout to ensure a proper 2x2 grid instead of vertical stacking.

### DETAILS
The issue involved incorrect CSS grid and HTML structure causing views to stack vertically instead of forming a CAD-style 2x2 quad layout. The fix involved modifying CSS grid properties to create two columns and two rows, restructuring the HTML to make all four views direct children of the grid container, and removing unused CSS classes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`viewport.css`**: Contains CSS rules for `.viewport-grid` to enforce a 2x2 grid layout.
- **`visualization-view-component.js`**: Manages the HTML structure to ensure all four views are direct children of the grid container.

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation/frontend/styles/viewport.css`, `simulation/frontend/components/visualization-view-component.js`, `00-2d-3d-layout-enhancement.md`

### USAGE
Apply the updated CSS and HTML structure to ensure the UI renders a 2x2 quad view layout. Verify by checking grid properties and direct child relationships in the DOM.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fix ensures all four views are equally sized and positioned in a 2x2 grid layout, improving visual consistency and usability.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure no additional nested grid structures are introduced, as they may disrupt the intended layout. Test with different view sizes to confirm responsiveness.
