### SUMMARY
Validates a custom CSS redesign by verifying color consistency, layout, and interactive states against a predefined design reference.

### DETAILS
This script uses `axios` to fetch and validate an HTML file (`sample01.html`) with a redesigned CSS implementation. It logs verification steps for color palette, layout, typography, and interactive states, ensuring the redesign matches a design reference exactly without relying on external frameworks like Tailwind CSS. The test includes manual verification steps for browser inspection and functional checks.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testCSSRedesign()**: Asynchronous function that fetches the HTML file and logs verification results for CSS redesign.
- **axios.get()**: Fetches the HTML file from a local filesystem with HTTPS agent configuration to bypass SSL verification.

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `node:https`

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a Node.js environment.
2. The script logs verification results for:
   - Color palette implementation (e.g., background, borders, accents).
   - Layout specifications (e.g., flex containers, card grids).
   - Typography and interactive states (e.g., hover/active effects).
3. Check console output for errors or mismatches.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script intentionally disables SSL certificate validation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) for local file access, which may not be secure for production use.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure the local HTML file (`sample01.html`) exists at the specified path (`file:///Users/amac/Downloads/spq8/preparation/sample01.html`) before execution.
