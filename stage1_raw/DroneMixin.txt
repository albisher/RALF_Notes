### SUMMARY
Provides drone functionality as a Vue component mixin for state management and API interactions.

### DETAILS
`DroneMixin` is a Vue.js mixin designed to encapsulate drone-related logic, including state management, API communication, and drone operations. It leverages the **mixin pattern** for code reuse, integrating `DroneState`, `DroneComputed`, and `DroneService` to handle drone lifecycle (e.g., fetching, spawning) and emits events for error handling or drone creation. The mixin initializes a `DroneService` instance dynamically from a global API endpoint (`window.apiCommunicationBox` or `window.apiBox`) and delegates drone operations (e.g., `fetchDrones`, `spawnDrone`) to it. Data is merged with `DroneState` to maintain local state consistency.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`data()`**: Initializes drone state and service, merging `DroneState` data.
- **`created()`**: Checks for and initializes `DroneService` with the global API endpoint.
- **`fetchDrones()`**: Asynchronously retrieves all drones from the API and updates local state via `DroneState.setDrones()`.
- **`updateDrones(force)`**: Alias for `fetchDrones()`; forces an update if `force=true`.
- **`spawnDrone(type, position, options)`**: Creates a new drone via `DroneService.spawnDrone()`, updates local state, and emits `drone-spawned`/`error` events.

### DEPENDENCIES
`../state/DroneState.js`, `../computed/DroneComputed.js`, `../services/DroneService.js`

### USAGE
1. Import and use the mixin in a Vue component:
   ```javascript
   import DroneMixin from './DroneMixin.js';
   export default {
       mixins: [DroneMixin],
       methods: {
           // Override or extend mixin methods as needed
       }
   };
   ```
2. Trigger drone operations via `this.fetchDrones()` or `this.spawnDrone(type, position, options)`.
3. Listen for emitted events (`drone-spawned`, `error`) in parent components.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dynamic API Initialization
> The mixin checks `window.apiCommunicationBox` or `window.apiBox` at runtime to avoid hardcoding API endpoints. If neither is found, it logs an error.
>[!WARNING]- Error Handling
> All async operations (e.g., `fetchDrones`, `spawnDrone`) include try-catch blocks. Errors are logged and emitted via `$emit('error', message)`. Local state updates may fail silently if `DroneState` methods throw.
