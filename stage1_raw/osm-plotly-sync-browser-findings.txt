### SUMMARY
Browser verification report for OSM-Plotly synchronization system, highlighting functional components and critical issues in GPS preset selection, OSM building loading, and empty viewports.

### DETAILS
This document details findings from browser-based verification of an OSM-Plotly synchronization system using Vue components, Socket.IO, and Cesium viewers. While core functionality like page loading, view toggling, and camera reset works, critical issues prevent proper functionality: incorrect GPS preset dropdown values, failed OSM building API fetches, and empty visualization viewports. The verification was conducted via browser MCP tools on December 20, 2025.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`simulation/frontend/components/header-component.js`**: Manages GPS preset dropdown selection logic.
- **`simulation/frontend/boxes/osm-integration-box.js`**: Handles OSM building data loading via Overpass API.
- **`loadBuildingsFromOverpass()`**: Method responsible for fetching OSM building data with fallback mechanisms.
- **Socket.IO & Vue Components**: Enables real-time synchronization between OSM and Plotly views.

### DEPENDENCIES
Overpass API, Cesium Ion, Socket.IO, Vue.js, Plotly.js, browser-based testing tools (MCP).

### USAGE
To resolve issues:
1. Fix dropdown values in `header-component.js` to match expected preset keys.
2. Investigate Overpass API connectivity and bounding box calculations in `osm-integration-box.js`.
3. Ensure proper data flow between OSM and Plotly visualization components.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The Overpass API fallback mechanism (`Cesium Ion OSM Buildings`) is being used as a secondary source, but the primary API fetch fails, indicating a deeper connectivity or configuration issue.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Incorrect GPS coordinates (e.g., `44.1253970, -146.97008`) will persist until the dropdown logic in `header-component.js` is corrected, leading to misaligned map views.
