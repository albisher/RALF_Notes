### SUMMARY
Classifies and defines major terrestrial land biomes with descriptions of their ecosystems.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates and categorizes major terrestrial land biomes, each representing distinct climate, vegetation, and ecological characteristics. Biomes like **Desert** and **Tundra** exhibit extreme environmental conditions, while **Temperate Forest** and **Grassland** support moderate biodiversity. The classification helps in ecological studies, climate modeling, and conservation efforts by defining regional ecosystem types.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Desert**: Hot, arid environments with sparse vegetation, dominated by drought-resistant plants.
- **Tropical Forest**: High biodiversity, warm and humid climates with dense canopy layers.
- **Temperate Forest**: Moderate temperatures, seasonal changes, and mixed forest ecosystems.
- **Boreal Forest (Taiga)**: Cold, coniferous forests with long winters and short summers.
- **Grassland (Savanna/Prairie)**: Open landscapes with grasses, adapted to seasonal droughts.
- **Tundra**: Treeless, cold, and frozen soil, supporting hardy perennials.
- **Ice Cap**: Polar regions with perpetual ice/snow, minimal plant life.
- **Mountainous**: High-altitude ecosystems with steep gradients and diverse microclimates.
- **Urban**: Human-dominated landscapes with altered ecosystems and high human activity.
- **Swamp**: Wetland biomes with standing water, supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic species.
- **Volcanic**: Geologically active regions with nutrient-rich soils and unique flora/fauna.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone classification list)

### USAGE
This list is used for:
- **Ecological research** (e.g., habitat mapping, species distribution studies).
- **Climate science** (e.g., biome classification in global models).
- **Conservation planning** (e.g., identifying protected areas).
- **Educational purposes** (e.g., teaching biodiversity or environmental systems).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Ecological Significance
> Each biome plays a critical role in carbon cycling, water regulation, and species adaptation. Misclassification can lead to inaccurate ecological predictions.
>[!WARNING]- Human Impact
> Urbanization, deforestation, and climate change threaten many biomes, requiring adaptive conservation strategies. Overgeneralization (e.g., lumping Savanna/Prairie) may oversimplify regional variations.
