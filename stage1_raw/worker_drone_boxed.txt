### SUMMARY
Worker drone implementation using a box-based architecture for path planning and control.

### DETAILS
The `WorkerDroneBoxed` class extends `BaseDrone` and refactors drone navigation using `PathPlannerBox` for path generation. It integrates a GPS tracker (`GPSTracker`) and battery model (`BatteryModel`) for autonomous operations. The drone processes commands via `receive_command`, delegating path planning to `PathPlannerBox` while optionally using `MLControllerBox` for advanced control (falling back to PID if disabled). Navigation state includes waypoint tracking, connection status, and performance metrics.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__`**: Initializes drone with box-based components (path planner, ML controller), sensors (GPS, battery), and navigation state.
- **`receive_command`**: Parses incoming commands (e.g., `move_to`) and triggers path planning via `PathPlannerBox`.
- **`_plan_path_to_target`** (implicitly called): Internal method to generate a path to a target position using `PathPlannerBox`.

### DEPENDENCIES
`.base_drone`, `.gps_tracker`, `.battery_model`, `.boxes` (contains `PathPlannerBox`, `MLControllerBox`), `numpy`, `time`.

### USAGE
1. Instantiate `WorkerDroneBoxed` with drone ID, initial position, physics client, and worker ID.
2. Set `use_ml_control=True` to enable ML-based control (default: PID fallback).
3. Send commands (e.g., `move_to`) via `receive_command` to update target position/height.
4. Path planning is handled internally by `PathPlannerBox`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Path Delegation
> All navigation logic is encapsulated in `PathPlannerBox`, ensuring modularity and reusability. Avoid bypassing this interface to maintain consistency.
>[!WARNING]- Command Validation
> Ensure `command['type']` matches expected values (e.g., `'move_to'`). Invalid types may cause silent failures in path planning.
