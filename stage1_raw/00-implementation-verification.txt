### SUMMARY
Verification checklist for drone implementation, ensuring battery, motor, and control systems are correctly integrated and functioning.

### DETAILS
This document serves as a structured verification checklist for the implementation of drone systems, specifically focusing on battery model integration, motor model enhancements, master controller integration, movement during mapping, and client-side rendering. It confirms that all critical fixes are verified and implemented correctly across multiple drone modules and simulation files. The checklist includes detailed verification steps, file references, and ensures compliance with requirements like realistic battery management, accurate motor force application, and proper command processing.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`BatteryModel`**: Manages battery capacity, voltage, and power calculations.
- **`update()` (in drones)**: Updates power consumption based on motor thrusts.
- **`apply_thrust()` (in `base_drone.py`)**: Rewrites force application for motor positions and torque calculations.
- **`step()` (in `hmrs_simulation_live.py`)**: Processes command queue system for drone control.
- **`_update_mapping()` (in `hmrs_scout_drone.py`)**: Implements Z-pattern path planning for mapping.
- **`initializePlots()` & `updatePlots()` (in `hmrs_simulation_live.py`)**: Handles client-side rendering with Plotly.js.

### DEPENDENCIES
Plotly.js, `BatteryModel` class, `MLControllerBox` class, `/api/command` and `/api/data` endpoints.

### USAGE
This document is used internally for auditing and confirming that all drone-related components (battery, motor, control, mapping, and rendering) meet specified requirements before deployment. Reviewers check marked files and ensure no workarounds remain.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Critical Fixes Verified**: All battery-related workarounds (e.g., simple counters) have been removed, ensuring accurate power tracking and battery status checks.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Real-Time Dependencies**: Ensure `/api/command` and `/api/data` endpoints are operational for command processing and real-time rendering updates. Disruptions here may break drone control or visualization.
