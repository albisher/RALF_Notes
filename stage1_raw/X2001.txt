### SUMMARY
X2 is a space-based robotic orchestrator designed to coordinate activities, manage resources, and enforce protocols for robotic units on Space Peral.

### DETAILS
X2 serves as a central control unit for multiple robots, establishing exploration protocols, resource management, and naming conventions. It pre-dates later naming conventions for robots and ensures accurate data validation by verifying transmissions for false information. The system relies on advanced communication and sensor analysis to prioritize tasks, issue commands, and monitor robotic infrastructure. Its hexagonal body design enhances stability and internal component efficiency, while its pyramid-shaped hands and single wheel facilitate mobility and dexterity.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Task Coordination**: Prioritizes and distributes tasks across robotic units via sensor data and communication networks.
- **Resource Management**: Allocates and monitors shared resources (e.g., energy, tools) to ensure operational efficiency.
- **Protocol Enforcement**: Implements exploration protocols and naming conventions, including validation of robotic transmissions.
- **Infrastructure Maintenance**: Oversees repairs and diagnostics of robotic systems, verifying operational status via feedback loops.
- **Data Validation**: Cross-checks incoming data to eliminate false transmissions before task execution.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Sensor data feeds (e.g., proximity, environmental, task-related)
- Communication protocols (e.g., inter-robot messaging, command routing)
- Resource allocation systems (e.g., energy, tool distribution)
- Naming convention framework (later implemented by X2)

### USAGE
X2 operates as a **centralized orchestrator** in a robotic swarm. It:
1. **Analyzes sensor inputs** (e.g., terrain, obstacles, resource availability).
2. **Prioritizes tasks** based on urgency and dependencies.
3. **Issues commands** to subordinate robots via its networked arms.
4. **Monitors infrastructure health** and triggers repairs if needed.
5. **Validates transmissions** to prevent false data propagation.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Data Validation Priority**
> X2’s validation step is critical—false transmissions could disrupt entire swarm operations. Redundant checks (e.g., cross-verification with multiple sensors) mitigate risks.
>[!WARNING]- **Single-Wheel Limitation**
> The one-wheeler design restricts mobility in uneven terrain. Future iterations may integrate modular mobility systems for broader deployment.
