### SUMMARY
Describes shallow ocean fruit types and their ecological roles in biome definitions.

### DETAILS
This file likely defines the types of "fruit" or organic matter found in shallow ocean biomes, such as Gelatinous Sacs and Gas-filled Bladders. These elements could represent floating or buoyant organic structures that contribute to marine ecosystems, potentially influencing navigation, food sources, or habitat dynamics in simulated or fictional environments.

The terms suggest adaptations to shallow marine conditions, where buoyancy and organic composition play key roles in ecological interactions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Gelatinous Sacs**: Buoyant, gelatinous structures that drift in shallow waters, possibly serving as food or shelter for marine organisms.
- **Gas-filled Bladders**: Lightweight, gas-filled organ-like formations that float, likely aiding in buoyancy or serving as a nutrient source.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone descriptive list)

### USAGE
These terms would typically be referenced in biome definitions, ecological simulations, or narrative descriptions of shallow ocean environments to define organic matter types.

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Ecological Role
> These elements may represent natural phenomena like floating seaweed clusters, jellyfish colonies, or specialized marine plants adapted to shallow waters.
>[!WARNING]- Context Sensitivity
> In a structured system (e.g., game/environment design), ensure these terms are assigned specific properties (e.g., buoyancy, toxicity, or interaction rules) to avoid ambiguity.
