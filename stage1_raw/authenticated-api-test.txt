### SUMMARY
Test framework for validating authenticated API interactions with a sci-fi world (Space Peral) featuring robotic ecosystems and environmental data.

### DETAILS
This file defines a structured test dataset for Space Peral, a fictional world designed to simulate robotic exploration and settlement challenges. It includes world metadata, robotic roles, and environmental elements (plants, animals, buildings) that would interact with an API. The data mirrors a sci-fi narrative where X-Series robots operate in a high-radiation, blue-sun environment, requiring specialized functions for mapping, resource management, and habitat construction. The test data is organized hierarchically (world → robots → ecosystems) to reflect modular API endpoints, enabling validation of authentication, data retrieval, and role-specific operations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`API_BASE`**: Configures the root URL for API requests (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/api`).
- **`spacePeralData`**: Centralized test payload containing:
  - **`world`**: Metadata (name, description, genre, theme).
  - **`robots`**: Role-specific robotic units with unique seeds (e.g., `X1` as an aerial drone).
  - **`plants/animals/buildings`**: Environmental and infrastructure data tied to robotic functions.
  - **`story`**: Narrative context for API testing (e.g., challenges like UV radiation, water scarcity).

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `none` (external libraries; assumes backend API uses `axios` for requests).

### USAGE
1. **Initialize**: Use `axios` to send authenticated requests to `API_BASE` endpoints.
2. **Test Endpoints**:
   - Retrieve world metadata: `/world` (e.g., `GET /world`).
   - Query robots by role: `/robots?role=AerialSurveyDrone`.
   - Simulate environmental interactions (e.g., `/buildings?name=BlueCityCommandCenter`).
3. **Validate**: Compare responses against `spacePeralData` for consistency.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Modular Design**
> The hierarchical structure (`world → robots → ecosystems`) aligns with API modularity, allowing granular testing of authentication and role-specific endpoints (e.g., `/robots/X1` vs. `/robots/X6`).
>[!WARNING]- **Environmental Nuances**
> The blue sun’s UV radiation and atmospheric filtering (e.g., `X6`) require API validation for error handling in high-radiation scenarios. Test edge cases like failed resource extraction (e.g., `X10` mining failures).
