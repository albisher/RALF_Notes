### SUMMARY
Describes unique fruit types found in volcanic biomes, emphasizing mineral-rich and crystalline characteristics.

### DETAILS
This document categorizes and defines distinct fruit types adapted to volcanic environments, where extreme conditions shape their physical traits. The listed types—**Mineralized Nodules**, **Capsules (dry, dehiscent)**, and **Geode-like Fruits (crystalline interior)**—reflect adaptations to nutrient-rich, unstable, or geologically active ecosystems. These traits likely aid survival by providing mineral reserves, protection, or dispersal mechanisms in harsh volcanic terrain.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Mineralized Nodules**: Fruits containing concentrated minerals (e.g., silica, metals) for nutrient storage or defense.
- **Capsules (dry, dehiscent)**: Dry, split-open fruits that release seeds or spores in dry volcanic conditions.
- **Geode-like Fruits (crystalline interior)**: Fruits with a hard, crystalline core (e.g., quartz or volcanic glass) for protection or mineral accumulation.

### DEPENDENIES
none

### USAGE
This document serves as a reference for ecological studies, biodiversity mapping, or creative writing (e.g., fantasy ecosystems) focusing on volcanic biomes. Researchers or writers may use these traits to design organisms or ecosystems with mineral-based adaptations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Ecological Significance
> These traits likely enhance survival in volcanic zones by providing mineral reserves (e.g., nodules) or dispersal advantages (e.g., dehiscent capsules).
>[!WARNING]- Environmental Sensitivity
> Crystalline fruits (geodes) may be fragile; their durability depends on local volcanic activity (e.g., lava flows).
