### SUMMARY
Generates a modular robot body with segmented shells, snap features, screw holes, and articulated legs using Blender’s Python API.

### DETAILS
This script creates a hollow spherical robot body by first defining an outer and inner sphere, then subtracting the inner sphere to form a cylindrical shell. It divides the body into **8 evenly spaced segments (shells)** using Boolean intersection operations with rotated cubes. Each shell is then enhanced with **snap features** (cylindrical protrusions) and **screw holes** (cylindrical cutouts) at predefined angular positions. The script also adds a **shrunken black shell**, a **faceplate**, and **two symmetrical eyes** (as line segments) for facial features. Finally, it constructs **4 identical 3-joint legs** (upper cylinder, joint sphere, lower cylinder, foot shell, and shell connector) with snap attachments and screw holes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`body_diameter`/`body_radius`**: Defines the robot’s outer dimensions.
- **Boolean operations (`DIFFERENCE`, `INTERSECT`, `UNION`)**: Modifies mesh geometry via subtraction, intersection, and union.
- **Shell segmentation loop**: Creates and positions 8 rotational cutters to split the body into segments.
- **Snap feature generation**: Adds cylindrical protrusions for modular assembly.
- **Screw hole placement**: Creates cylindrical cutouts for fastening.
- **Leg assembly**: Constructs 4 identical articulated legs with joint spheres and cylindrical components.
- **Faceplate & eyes**: Adds a top plate and two line-based eyes for facial aesthetics.

### DEPENDENCIES
Blender Python API (`bpy`, `bmesh`, `mathutils`), custom variables (`unit_scale`, `body_diameter`, etc.).

### USAGE
1. Run in Blender’s **Scripting** workspace.
2. Adjust `body_diameter`, `wall_thickness`, or `num_shells` to modify robot size/structure.
3. Modify `screw_radius`, `snap_depth`, or leg dimensions for customization.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses **Boolean modifiers** (`DIFFERENCE`, `INTERSECT`) to create hollow shells and modular joints. Ensure Blender’s **Boolean operations are enabled** in the modifier settings.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Deleting objects (`bpy.data.objects.remove`) permanently removes them from the scene. Backup objects before execution if needed.
> Leg components are **parented** to the faceplate; ensure the faceplate exists before running leg assembly.
