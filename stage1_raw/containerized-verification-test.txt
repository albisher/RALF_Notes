### SUMMARY
Verifies that all application services run in Docker containers, ensuring no local development servers interfere.

### DETAILS
This script performs a containerized services verification by checking if the application and its dependencies (frontend, backend, database, cache) are running exclusively within Docker containers. It uses `axios` to confirm the main application endpoint (`https://localhost:8443`) is accessible, bypassing local Node.js/Python servers. The script logs container statuses, service ports, and manual verification steps, validating Docker orchestration and containerized dependencies.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testContainerizedServices()**: Orchestrates the verification by checking containerized services, logging statuses, and handling errors.
- **axios.get()**: Fetches the main application endpoint with HTTPS agent configuration to bypass SSL certificate validation.

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, Node.js runtime, `https` module (built-in), Docker CLI tools (for manual verification steps).

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly (`node containerized-verification-test.js`).
2. Verify logs confirm:
   - No local development servers are running.
   - All Docker containers (`space-pearl-*`) are active.
   - Application (`localhost:8443`) loads successfully.
3. Cross-check with manual commands (`docker-compose ps`, `docker logs`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes Docker is running and containers (`space-pearl-*`) are pre-deployed. Manually verify container statuses if logs show inconsistencies.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Disabling SSL validation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) is for testing only. In production, enforce strict SSL checks.
