### SUMMARY
Automated dashboard UI validation using Puppeteer to verify login and UI structure.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to automate a dashboard login and validate UI elements. It launches a browser with custom Chrome options, logs in with predefined credentials, captures a screenshot, and checks for key dashboard components (title, sidebar, navigation, cards) via JavaScript evaluation. It also verifies the current URL and text content for expected keywords like "Dashboard" and "Welcome."

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **DashboardTest**: Main class initializing browser launch, credentials, and test execution.
- **runTest()**: Core method handling browser setup, login, UI validation, and cleanup.
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript on the rendered page to inspect DOM elements.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures the dashboard UI as a static image.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Google Chrome (hardcoded path).

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node dashboard-test.js`.
3. Ensure the dashboard runs on `https://localhost:8443` with test credentials (`test/testpass`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses hardcoded Chrome path (`/Applications/Google Chrome.app`), which may fail on non-Mac systems. Replace with a system-specific path or use `puppeteer.launch()` with a default executable.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Disabling security features (`--disable-web-security`) may expose the app to XSS risks. Use only in controlled environments.
