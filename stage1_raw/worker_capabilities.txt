### SUMMARY
Tracks and dynamically adjusts worker capabilities via probabilistic scoring and success/failure history.

### DETAILS
This module defines a `WorkerCapabilities` system where each worker’s abilities (e.g., flight, inspection) are initialized with default scores (0.0–1.0) and refined based on success/failure attempts. The `CapabilityType` enum categorizes skills, while `update_capability()` adjusts scores: success raises them (up to 1.0), failure lowers them (down to 0.1). The `can_perform()` method checks if a worker meets a threshold (default 0.3) for a given capability, and `get_best_capabilities()` returns the top *count* skills by score.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__(worker_id)`**: Initializes worker capabilities with default scores and zero success/failure history.
- **`update_capability(capability, success)`**: Dynamically updates a capability’s score based on success/failure.
- **`can_perform(capability, min_score=0.3)`**: Returns `True` if the worker’s score meets or exceeds `min_score`.
- **`get_best_capabilities(count=3)`**: Returns the top *count* capabilities by score (e.g., flight, inspection).

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy (for potential future extensions), typing (for type hints), enum (for `CapabilityType` enum).

### USAGE
1. Instantiate `WorkerCapabilities(worker_id)` to initialize a worker’s skills.
2. Call `update_capability(capability, success)` after each attempt (e.g., `worker.update_capability(CapabilityType.FLIGHT, True)`).
3. Query capabilities with `can_perform()` or retrieve top skills via `get_best_capabilities()`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Capability Thresholds
> Default `min_score` in `can_perform()` is 0.3, but can be adjusted to fine-tune difficulty.
>[!WARNING]- Skill Cap Limits
> Scores cap at 1.0 (max proficiency) and floor at 0.1 (min viable capability). Avoid extreme values.
