### SUMMARY
Analyzes certainty in understanding a sci-fi procedural content generation system’s architecture, dependencies, and design choices.

### DETAILS
This file presents a structured **certainty analysis** of a procedural content generation system for the sci-fi universe *Space Peral*, focusing on its technical architecture, content types, and integration points. The document uses a table-based format to rate confidence levels (0–100%) in various claims about the system’s design, including its use of **deterministic hash-based algorithms** (SHA-256), **modular generators** for robots/plants/buildings/characters, and **Flask/Blender integration**. Unmarked points indicate areas of uncertainty, while marked points reflect high confidence (e.g., procedural generation via text-based configs, modular architecture). The analysis also highlights gaps in understanding (e.g., Blender API usage, real-time web feedback).

The system’s core logic revolves around **input hashing** to produce consistent outputs, with attributes defined via text files. Dependencies include **Flask** (web backend), **Blender** (3D modeling), and **Python libraries** (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`). The design prioritizes **extensibility** through modular generators, though performance and integration specifics (e.g., Blender export formats) remain unclear.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Procedural Content Generation**: Uses deterministic hashing to create consistent, repeatable content (robots, plants, buildings, characters).
- **Modular Generators**: Separate generators for each content type, configured via text files.
- **Flask Web Interface**: User interaction layer for generating and visualizing content.
- **Blender Integration**: Handles 3D model rendering and export.
- **Text-Based Configuration**: Attribute lists stored in plain-text files for easy editing.

### DEPENDENCIES
Python, Flask, Blender, Blender Python API (`bpy`), `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`, JSON/text files.

### USAGE
To validate or extend the system:
1. **Review Text Configs**: Verify attribute lists in `.txt` files (e.g., `robots_config.txt`).
2. **Test Determinism**: Confirm identical inputs produce identical outputs (e.g., same hash → same robot).
3. **Integrate Flask**: Deploy the web app to interact with the system via a browser.
4. **Blender Export**: Use Blender to render and export generated 3D models.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Uncertainty
> **Blender Integration**: While Blender is confirmed for 3D modeling, specifics like export formats (e.g., `.fbx`) or real-time feedback during generation are unconfirmed. Clarify Blender API usage (e.g., `bpy.ops` commands) to resolve this.
>[!WARNING]- Deterministic Risks
> **Hash Collisions**: SHA-256 collisions are astronomically rare but theoretically possible. Audit hash-based generation for edge cases (e.g., identical inputs producing slightly different outputs due to rounding or system quirks).
>[!INFO]- Text Config Best Practices
> **Modularity**: Text files should follow a standardized format (e.g., `category/attribute_list.txt`). Inconsistent naming (e.g., `X-Series` vs. `Warrior` in robot configs) may break deterministic generation. Standardize attribute keys across all content types.
