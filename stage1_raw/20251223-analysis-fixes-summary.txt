### SUMMARY
Applies fixes for Vue.js frontend components to ensure proper rendering and data synchronization across navigation routes, particularly for drones control, session analysis, and ML learning data.

### DETAILS
The document details fixes for critical rendering and data synchronization issues in a Vue.js frontend application. The core problem was that components registered via URL routing (`currentView`) failed to render correctly when navigating directly to specific routes (`/dc`, `/sa`, `/ml`) due to unsynchronized reactivity. Fixes involved using `$nextTick()` to ensure `currentView` updates and triggers view-specific initialization (e.g., `loadDroneConfigurations()`, `loadSessions()`, `fetchMLLearningData()`) on initial load or route changes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`mounted()`**: Initializes `currentView` sync with URL routing and triggers view-specific logic.
- **`$nextTick()`**: Ensures Vue reactivity updates before rendering.
- **`urlRoutingBox.getCurrentView()`**: Extracts the current route from the URL.
- **`loadDroneConfigurations()`**: Loads drone configurations for the drones-control view.
- **`loadSessions()`**: Loads session data for the session analysis view.
- **`fetchMLLearningData()`**: Fetches ML learning data for the ML learning view.
- **`layoutNavBox.setCurrentView()`**: Updates the UI layout based on the current view.

### DEPENDENCIES
`urlRoutingBox`, `layoutNavBox`, Vue.js reactivity system, `fetch` API (for data fetching).

### USAGE
To apply these fixes:
1. Navigate directly to routes like `/dc`, `/sa`, or `/ml` without triggering a full page reload.
2. The `$nextTick()` callback ensures `currentView` is updated and triggers the correct initialization function (e.g., `loadDroneConfigurations()` for `/dc`).
3. Data fetching (e.g., `fetchMLLearningData()`) is now guaranteed to execute on initial load or route changes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Reactivity Issue
> The root cause was Vue’s reactivity not syncing with URL-based navigation. `$nextTick()` ensures `currentView` updates before rendering, preventing stale state.
>[!WARNING]- Data Fetching Edge Case
> If `handleViewChange()` is not called explicitly (e.g., via programmatic navigation), the auto-fetch logic in `$nextTick()` ensures data loads correctly. Test edge cases where navigation happens outside Vue lifecycle hooks.
