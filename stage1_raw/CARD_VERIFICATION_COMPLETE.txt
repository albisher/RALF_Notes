### SUMMARY
A comprehensive verification report confirming 100 cards (95 programmatic, 5 UI-style) were successfully created, displayed, and categorized across 13 types.

### DETAILS
This report documents a browser automation test verifying 100 card entries—95 programmatically generated and 5 manually created via UI—across 13 predefined types. It includes validation of display, modal functionality, type categorization, and data integrity, with fixes applied for API response handling discrepancies. Known issues (e.g., routing, rendering) remain unresolved but are noted for future attention.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Card Creation Methods**: Programmatic (API/console) and UI-based generation.
- **Card Display Grid**: Grid layout with sorting, filtering, and search functionality.
- **Modal Interaction**: Full card details, edit/delete actions, and timestamp validation.
- **Type Verification**: 13-card type badges/icons and filter functionality.
- **Data Mapping**: API-to-UI field conversion (e.g., `card_name` → `name`).

### DEPENDENCIES
`browsermcp`, `browser-tools`, `Vue.js` (for UI components), `GenerateStage.vue`, `useCardOperations.js`.

### USAGE
To reproduce:
1. Run browser automation scripts (`browsermcp`/`browser-tools`) to generate 95 programmatic cards.
2. Use UI interface to create 5 UI-style cards.
3. Validate display, modal, and type categorization via UI filters/search.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **API Response Handling Fix**
> Updated `GenerateStage.vue` to handle `result.success || result.id || result.card?.id` for `saveAsCard` method, resolving prior parsing errors.

>[!WARNING]- **Routing Limitation**
> The `#/generate` URL hash does not navigate correctly to the Generate stage; investigate Vue router configuration. Workaround: Use console scripts for programmatic cards.
