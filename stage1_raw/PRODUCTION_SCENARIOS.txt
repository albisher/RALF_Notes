### **SUMMARY**
Defines real-world production test scenarios for HMRS, covering hardware integration, mission workflows, and safety validation.

### **DETAILS**
This document outlines structured test scenarios for the **High-Rise Maintenance & Reconnaissance System (HMRS)**, designed for **production-level validation** across multiple domains, including real drone operations, mission planning, and emergency response. It categorizes scenarios by use case (e.g., physical hardware testing, swarm coordination) and provides detailed prerequisites, steps, and success criteria for each. The system integrates hardware (e.g., DJI drones), software (e.g., PX4, PyBullet simulation), and compliance modules (e.g., geofencing) to ensure reliability in real-world environments.

### **KEY_FUNCTIONS**
- **Command & Control Interface**: Web-based mission management for drone operations.
- **Real Drone Integration Layer**: SDK-based connectivity (DJI SDK, MAVLink) for physical drones.
- **Mission Planning System**: Route optimization and resource allocation for inspections.
- **Simulation Engine**: PyBullet-based training and validation for mission rehearsal.
- **Multi-Drone Coordination**: Swarm management and collision avoidance protocols.
- **Safety & Compliance Module**: Enforces geofencing, altitude limits, and regulatory checks.

### **DEPENDENCIES**
DJI SDK, PX4 firmware, MAVLink protocol, PyBullet, GPS hardware, thermal imaging sensors, geofencing APIs.

### **USAGE**
To execute a scenario:
1. Select a category (e.g., "Real Drone Operations").
2. Follow the **Prerequisites** (e.g., drone setup, permits).
3. Run the **Test Steps** sequentially, monitoring telemetry and compliance.
4. Verify **Success Criteria** (e.g., data capture, coverage, safety checks).

### **CALLOUTS**
>[!INFO]- Critical Hardware Requirement
> Ensure all drones meet **DJI Enterprise certification** and are pre-configured with HMRS-compatible firmware before testing.
>[!WARNING]- Environmental Constraints
> Avoid testing in high-wind or adverse weather conditions, as they may invalidate thermal imaging accuracy or drone stability. Always verify GPS lock and signal strength before takeoff.
