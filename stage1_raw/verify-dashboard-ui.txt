### SUMMARY
Automated UI verification script for a dashboard application using Puppeteer to validate dashboard content, navigation, and error conditions.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a browser, navigate to a local web application (running on `http://localhost:5173`), and systematically verify the dashboard UI. It captures screenshots at key stages, checks for specific UI elements (e.g., statistics cards, character/world listings), and logs console/network activity. The workflow includes validation of dashboard content, character/world pages, and error handling.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **verifyDashboardUI**: Orchestrates the entire UI verification process, including browser launch, navigation, UI checks, and screenshot capture.
- **puppeteer.launch**: Configures and starts a browser instance with debugging enabled.
- **page.goto**: Navigates to the application URL with network idle wait.
- **page.waitForSelector**: Ensures dashboard content loads before proceeding.
- **page.evaluate**: Extracts text content from dynamically rendered elements (e.g., stat cards).
- **page.screenshot**: Captures full-page screenshots at critical points.
- **page.click**: Simulates user navigation to characters/worlds pages.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node verify-dashboard-ui.js`.
3. Ensure the application is running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.
4. Outputs:
   - Console logs for verification steps.
   - Screenshots saved to `checks/screenshots/`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `--no-sandbox` and other flags for debugging, which may not be secure in production. Disable these in production environments.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Network requests and console logs are logged via `page.evaluate()`, which may expose sensitive data if not sanitized. Validate `networkRequests`/`consoleLogs` before use in production.
