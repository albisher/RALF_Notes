### SUMMARY
Summary of fixes applied to resolve drone movement issues in a simulation environment.

### DETAILS
This document details the root causes and fixes for drones failing to respond to `move_to` commands, including frame coordinate mismatches, priority issues in command processing, and insufficient control gains. Key modifications involved adjusting force application frames, prioritizing RC translator commands, increasing control parameters, and eliminating physics damping/friction. The changes were tested via a script and require a server restart for full implementation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`simulation/swarm/base_drone.py`**: Handles force application, RC translator priority, and control gains adjustments.
- **`simulation/swarm/boxes/rc_command_translator_box.py`**: Manages motor history and control gains for RC commands.
- **`simulation/swarm/model_loader.py`**: Configures physics dynamics (damping/friction) for movement.
- **`simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py`**: Processes and logs command execution for debugging.

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation/swarm`, `simulation/scripts`, Python libraries for simulation execution.

### USAGE
1. Stop the current simulation server.
2. Restart the server using `python simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py`.
3. Execute the test script `simulation/scripts/test_and_fix_movement.py` to verify fixes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> All fixes were applied in code but require a server restart to activate. Ensure the simulation environment is clean before restarting.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Modifying physics parameters (e.g., damping/friction) may alter stability. Test changes incrementally to avoid unintended behavior.
