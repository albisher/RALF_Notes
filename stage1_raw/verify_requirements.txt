### SUMMARY
Verifies HMRS system requirements against simulator capabilities and dependencies.

### DETAILS
This script checks whether the HMRS simulator meets predefined system requirements, including Python version compatibility, installed dependencies (e.g., PyBullet, NumPy), and simulator-specific capabilities (e.g., multi-robot support, real-time physics). It logs pass/fail statuses for each requirement and returns a boolean indicating overall success.

The script uses `importlib` to dynamically check installed packages, `sys` for Python version detection, and `numpy` for numerical validation. It initializes a `RequirementsVerifier` class to track results in a structured dictionary.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`check_python_version()`**: Validates Python version (3.10+) against the system.
- **`check_dependencies()`**: Tests if required packages (PyBullet, NumPy) are installed via `importlib.import_module()`.
- **`check_simulator_capabilities()`**: Instantiates a `QuadcopterSimulator` to verify headless mode and multi-robot support (incomplete due to missing full logic).

### DEPENDENCIES
`sys`, `importlib`, `numpy`, `typing`, `time`

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly to verify system requirements.
2. Call `RequirementsVerifier().check_python_version()` or `RequirementsVerifier().check_dependencies()` individually.
3. Append `check_simulator_capabilities()` to test simulator-specific features (e.g., `sim = QuadcopterSimulator(...)`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Missing Logic
> The `check_simulator_capabilities()` method currently only instantiates the simulator without fully validating its capabilities (e.g., sensor support, real-time performance). Extend this method to include assertions or runtime tests.
>[!WARNING]- Dynamic Imports
> Using `importlib.import_module()` for package checks may fail if modules are not in the Python path. Prefer explicit package checks (e.g., `try: importlib.import_module('pybullet')`) for robustness.
