### SUMMARY
A collection of fundamental 3D geometric shapes used for modeling and visualization.

### DETAILS
This file appears to list basic 3D shapes with names that imply standard mathematical or computational representations. The shapes (`sphere`, `cylinder`, `egg`, `semi-sphere`, `dome`) are likely candidates for parametric modeling, rendering, or collision detection in applications like game engines, simulations, or CAD systems. The "egg" shape suggests an irregular or non-geometric approximation, while "semi-sphere" and "dome" imply truncated or partial forms of a sphere.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **sphere**: Represents a perfect 3D circular shape, often used as a reference or base model.
- **cylinder**: A 3D shape with two circular bases connected by a curved surface, common in engineering and physics simulations.
- **egg**: Likely a custom or approximated shape (e.g., ellipsoid or Bézier curve-based) for non-spherical objects.
- **semi-sphere**: Half of a sphere, often used in architectural or design contexts.
- **dome**: A curved, dome-like shape (could be a hemisphere or a truncated version).

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed, but these shapes may rely on:
- Parametric modeling libraries (e.g., Blender’s `bpy` API, Unity’s `Mesh` generation).
- Mathematical functions (e.g., `math.sqrt`, `math.pi` for calculations).
- Optional: Collision detection libraries (e.g., `Bullet Physics` for physics simulations).

### USAGE
This file is likely a **reference or configuration** for:
1. **3D modeling tools** (e.g., importing these shapes into Blender or Maya).
2. **Procedural generation** (e.g., dynamically creating shapes in code).
3. **Visualization libraries** (e.g., plotting 3D shapes in Python with `matplotlib` or `pygame`).
4. **Game development** (e.g., defining static objects or collision shapes).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Common Use Case
> These shapes are foundational in **procedural generation** (e.g., procedural terrain, NPC placements) and **collision detection** (e.g., avoiding obstacles in games).
>[!WARNING]- Irregularity Warning
> The "egg" shape is non-standard and may require custom geometry handling (e.g., splines or subdivision surfaces). Avoid assuming it’s a perfect ellipsoid unless documented.
