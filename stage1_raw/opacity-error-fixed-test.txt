### SUMMARY
Tests and validates fixes for CSS parsing errors caused by Tailwind `@apply` utilities, ensuring opacity and styling consistency.

### DETAILS
This script performs an automated test to verify that CSS parsing errors (e.g., `"Error in parsing value for 'opacity'"`) are resolved by replacing Tailwind `@apply` utilities with standard CSS properties. It checks frontend functionality, dark mode toggle, and console error reduction after applying fixes to components like `.loading`, `.nav-link`, `.card`, and `.btn-primary`. The test uses `axios` to simulate API requests to a local server (`localhost:8443`) and logs success/failure states.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testOpacityErrorFixed()**: Runs automated validation of CSS fixes, logs test progress, and verifies error resolution.
- **Axios GET request**: Simulates frontend API calls to a local server with a disabled SSL certificate check.

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `node:https` (for `httpsAgent` configuration)

### USAGE
1. Execute via Node.js: `node opacity-error-fixed-test.js`.
2. Ensure the local server (`localhost:8443`) is running with the fixed frontend.
3. Verify manual steps (e.g., console checks, dark mode toggle) align with automated logs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This test assumes the server endpoint (`https://localhost:8443`) is accessible and the frontend container is restarted after CSS changes. Ignore SSL warnings during testing.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Manual steps (e.g., Step 5) must be executed in a clean browser session to avoid cached errors. Avoid mixing old and new CSS versions.
