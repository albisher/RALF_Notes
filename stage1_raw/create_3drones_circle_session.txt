### SUMMARY
Automates drone flight session creation for 3 drones flying circular paths at predefined altitudes.

### DETAILS
This script automates a drone flight session where three drones fly in circles of 3m diameter at 12m height using a local simulation API. It handles simulation setup, stopping, and waypoint generation via a custom `generate_circular_waypoints` function. The script interacts with a backend API (`http://localhost:5007`) to manage drone configurations and flight paths.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **generate_circular_waypoints**: Generates evenly spaced waypoints for a circular flight path around a given center with specified radius and height.
- **Session creation**: Initiates a new simulation session with demo buildings and drone configurations.
- **Simulation control**: Stops/resets the simulation if running before starting the flight session.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, time, json, numpy, math

### USAGE
1. Run the script to stop any existing simulation (if running).
2. Creates a new session named "3DronesCircle" with 2 buildings.
3. Starts the simulation and implicitly begins drone flight in circular paths.
4. Assumes a backend API (`BASE_URL`) is running at `http://localhost:5007`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the backend API (`BASE_URL`) is accessible and handles API calls with retries for transient failures.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Manual intervention may be needed if the API fails to respond after retries. Ensure the simulation server is running before execution.
