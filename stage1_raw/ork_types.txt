### SUMMARY
Defines and categorizes Ork character types for a tactical or tabletop game.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates distinct Ork units, each with unique roles in combat, leadership, or specialization. The types reflect thematic archetypes (e.g., warriors, shamanic casters, raiders) and hierarchical or functional groupings (e.g., "Warrior Ork" vs. "Ancient Ork"). These classifications likely serve as foundational data for balancing, unit stats, or narrative roles in gameplay.

- **Scout Ork**: Mobility-focused, stealth/range-based tactics.
- **Hunter Ork**: Archery specialist, ranged damage.
- **Blacksmith Ork**: Crafting/upgrading support.
- **Brute Ork**: Tanky, heavy armor, melee dominance.
- **Savage Ork**: Hybrid (ranged + melee), versatile.
