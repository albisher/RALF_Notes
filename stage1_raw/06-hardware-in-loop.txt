### SUMMARY
Explains PX4 Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) setups for realistic drone testing.

### DETAILS
This document details **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL)** and **Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)** configurations for PX4 autopilots. SITL runs the real firmware in a simulated environment (e.g., Gazebo) without hardware, enabling control algorithm testing. HITL connects real hardware to a simulator for realistic sensor/environment testing. Key components include Gazebo for simulation, MAVSDK for Python integration, and ROS2 with MAVROS2 for ROS-based control.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`make px4_sitl gazebo-classic`**: Starts PX4 SITL with Gazebo simulation.
- **`make px4_sitl gazebo-classic_iris`**: Runs SITL for a specific vehicle model (e.g., Iris).
- **`asyncio.run(run())` (MAVSDK)**: Connects to SITL via UDP and controls drone via offboard mode.
- **`ros2 launch mavros px4.launch.py`**: Launches MAVROS2 for ROS2 integration with SITL.
- **`PX4Controller` (ROS2)**: Publishes position setpoints to control drone via MAVROS2.

### DEPENDENCIES
- PX4-Autopilot GitHub repo (recursively cloned),
- Gazebo Classic (for SITL),
- MAVSDK (Python),
- ROS2 (Humble), MAVROS2,
- Python libraries (`python3-pip`, `pip3 install --user -r Tools/setup/requirements.txt`).

### USAGE
1. **SITL Setup**:
   - Clone PX4 repo and install dependencies.
   - Run `make px4_sitl gazebo-classic` to start simulation.
   - Use MAVSDK/ROS2 to interact with the simulated drone.

2. **HITL Setup**:
   - Requires real PX4 hardware (e.g., flight controller).
   - Connect hardware to Gazebo via UDP/ROS2 interfaces.
   - Test real autopilot behavior with simulated sensors/environment.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> SITL is ideal for **algorithm development** (e.g., PID tuning) due to full control over simulated sensors/environment. Hardware (HITL) is needed for **real-world robustness testing** (e.g., sensor noise, power constraints).

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure **firewall rules** allow UDP traffic (e.g., port `14540`) for SITL/ROS2 connections. Misconfigured ports may break communication. Always verify **vehicle model compatibility** (e.g., `iris` vs. `classic`).
