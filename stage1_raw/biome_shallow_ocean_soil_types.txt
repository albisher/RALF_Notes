### SUMMARY
Describes soil type classifications for shallow ocean biomes, emphasizing organic and silicate-rich compositions.

### DETAILS
This file categorizes soil types found in shallow ocean environments, focusing on two primary compositions: **Organic-rich** (derived from decomposed marine organisms) and **Silicate-rich** (mineral-based, sourced from volcanic or sedimentary deposits). The term *Hydroponic* is likely a placeholder or misnomer here, potentially referencing nutrient-rich, water-based conditions rather than a distinct soil type.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Organic-rich**: Represents soil enriched with decomposed organic matter (e.g., plankton, coral, or algae), critical for microbial activity and nutrient cycling in shallow marine ecosystems.
- **Silicate-rich**: Indicates mineral-dominated soil, often formed from weathered volcanic rock or sediment, providing essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.
- **Hydroponic**: Describes a non-soil condition where nutrients are dissolved in water (e.g., nutrient films or recirculating aquaculture systems), though its relevance here may be context-dependent.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone classification system)

### USAGE
This classification is typically used in:
- **Ecological modeling** of shallow marine biomes (e.g., coral reefs, mangroves).
- **Biofilm or sediment analysis** in oceanographic research.
- **Game/environment design** for biome-specific soil properties (e.g., game engines like Unity/Unreal).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Note
> In shallow ocean settings, **organic-rich** soils often correlate with high primary productivity (e.g., phytoplankton blooms), while **silicate-rich** soils may limit plant growth due to nutrient scarcity unless supplemented by upwelling.
>[!WARNING]- Terminology Clarification
> "Hydroponic" here is ambiguous—if referring to nutrient solutions, it’s not a soil type but a growth medium. Verify its intended meaning in the broader project context.
