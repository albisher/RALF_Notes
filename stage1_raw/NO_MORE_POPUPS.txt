### SUMMARY
Removes all popup alerts from the UI beta codebase by replacing them with a non-blocking toast notification system.

### DETAILS
The codebase transitioned from traditional `alert()` popups (which block user interaction) to a modern toast notification system. This change eliminates 13 previously existing popup alerts while introducing a reusable, globally integrated toast component (`ToastNotification.vue`) and service (`toast-service.js`). The new system supports multiple notification types (success, error, warning, info) with customizable durations, auto-dismissal, and smooth animations. The implementation ensures better UX by preventing UI interruptions and allows multiple notifications to stack vertically.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`ToastNotification.vue`**: Displays toast messages with animations and dismiss buttons.
- **`toast-service.js`**: Manages toast logic, including type dispatching (success/error/warning/info) and duration handling.
- **`src/App.vue`**: Integrates the toast component globally for all pages.
- **`WorkflowPage.vue` & `GenerateStage.vue`**: Replaced legacy `alert()` calls with toast notifications.

### DEPENDENCIES
React/Vue framework, Vuex (likely), Material Design Icons library (for icons), possibly `vue-toastify` or similar toast library (not explicitly listed but implied by design).

### USAGE
To use the toast system, import `toastService` and call methods like:
```javascript
toastService.success('Message');
toastService.error('Error message');
toastService.warning('Warning message');
```
Custom durations can be passed as the second argument (in milliseconds).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Verification Check**
> Run `grep -r "alert(" ui-beta/src` to confirm no legacy alerts remain. Linter errors were also confirmed absent across all files.
>[!WARNING]- **Testing Requirement**
> Ensure manual dismiss functionality works (clicking the X icon should close the toast). Test edge cases like rapid successive notifications to verify stacking behavior.
