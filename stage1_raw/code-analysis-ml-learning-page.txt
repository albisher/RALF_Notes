### SUMMARY
Component for displaying and managing machine learning data for drone systems, including fetching, rendering, and interactive selection features.

### DETAILS
This component (`MLLearningPageComponent`) manages the UI for a machine learning learning page, specifically for drones. It expects a `currentView` prop to validate the context (`'ml-learning'`), and renders a `MLLearningViewComponent` when active. The component handles loading, error states, and data-driven UI elements like drone lists, selection controls, and summary statistics. The data flow originates from an API endpoint (`/api/ml-learning/data`) and is processed via `app-data.js` to update state (`mlLearningData`, `mlLearningDataLoading`, `mlLearningDataError`). The `MLLearningViewComponent` renders interactive UI elements such as checkboxes, badges, and metrics for each drone, with conditional logic for empty/error states.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **fetchMLLearningData**: Asynchronous function in `app-data.js` that fetches ML data from `/api/ml-learning/data`, updates loading/error states, and parses JSON responses.
- **MLLearningViewComponent**: Renders the UI for drone data, including headers, action buttons, loading/error states, summary stats, and drone lists with ML-enabled indicators.
- **@fetch-ml-learning-data**: Event handler to trigger data refresh.
- **@select-all-ml-drones**: Event handler to toggle selection for all drones.
- **@clear-ml-selection**: Event handler to clear all selections.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Vue.js (or React-compatible framework for rendering components)
- Fetch API (for API calls)
- `/api/ml-learning/data` (backend endpoint)

### USAGE
1. Set `currentView` to `'ml-learning'` in parent component to activate this page.
2. Provide `mlLearningData`, `mlLearningDataLoading`, and `mlLearningDataError` props to manage state.
3. Use `@fetch-ml-learning-data` to refresh data dynamically.
4. Interact with selection buttons (`Select All`, `Clear Selection`) to manage drone lists.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Data Flow Dependency
> The component relies on `app-data.js` for fetching and state management. Ensure `fetchMLLearningData` is called correctly to avoid race conditions or stale data.
>[!WARNING]- Error Handling
> If `mlLearningDataError` is not cleared properly, it may persist, causing UI flashes. Validate error cleanup in `finally` blocks.
