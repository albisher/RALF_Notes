### SUMMARY
Automated frontend test script using Puppeteer to validate Vue.js application loading and structure.

### DETAILS
This script launches a headless Chrome browser with Puppeteer, navigates to a Vue.js frontend running on `localhost:5173`, and performs checks for the Vue application's presence and structure. It evaluates the DOM for Vue-specific elements (classes starting with `v-`), captures the app's content, and saves a full-page screenshot. Error handling and cleanup are managed via `try/catch`/`finally` blocks.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testFrontend()**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including browser launch, navigation, DOM inspection, and cleanup.
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript in the browser context to inspect the DOM (e.g., checking for Vue app elements).
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures a full-page screenshot of the rendered Vue app.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node simple-frontend-test.js`.
3. Ensure a Vue.js app is running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the Vue app is hosted on `localhost:5173`. Adjust the URL if the frontend runs on a different port.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer in headless mode with `--no-sandbox` may expose security risks on non-trusted systems. Use with caution in production environments.
