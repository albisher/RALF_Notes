### SUMMARY
Enhanced drone learning system with dynamic scenario management, failure handling, and worker capability tracking.

### DETAILS
This file outlines a drone management system with six key features: manual drone spawning with a queue system, real-time drone monitoring (including battery, GPS, and success metrics), scenario selection via checkboxes, adaptive failure handling (switching to easier scenarios on repeated failures), a capability-based worker training system, and an AI-driven master learning module that optimizes worker-scenario assignments based on past outcomes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`POST /api/spawn`**: Spawns new drones with a queue system and concurrency limit.
- **`GET /api/drones`**: Returns real-time drone status (name, scenario, success rate, battery, etc.).
- **`POST /api/scenarios`**: Enables/disables scenario types for drones.
- **`GET /api/master-learning`**: Provides insights into failure patterns and worker capabilities.
- **Failure Handling Logic**: Automatically routes workers to easier scenarios after 3+ consecutive failures.
- **Capability Tracking**: Workers report skill levels (0.0–1.0) for flight, navigation, and specialized tasks.

### DEPENDENCIES
Obsidian: Web UI framework (React/Flask), drone API client, scenario engine, failure analytics library, worker capability database.

### USAGE
1. **Spawn Drones**: Use the "Spawn New Drone" button or API endpoint (`POST /api/spawn`).
2. **Monitor Drones**: Check the "Active Drones" panel (refreshes every 2 sec) for real-time stats.
3. **Select Scenarios**: Enable/disable scenarios via checkboxes in the "Scenario Selection Panel."
4. **Handle Failures**: System auto-switches workers to easier scenarios after 3 failures.
5. **Train Workers**: Capabilities improve with success, degrade with failures.
6. **Analyze Master Learning**: Review `GET /api/master-learning` for optimized worker-scenario assignments.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Concurrency Limit**
> Drones exceed the 5-concurrent limit → requests queue until slots free.
>[!WARNING]- **Scenario Dependency**
> Disabling a scenario type **deactivates all drones** attempting it; ensure enabled scenarios match worker capabilities.
>[!INFO]- **Auto-Update Risk**
> Real-time drone stats refresh every 2 sec → network lag may cause stale data.
