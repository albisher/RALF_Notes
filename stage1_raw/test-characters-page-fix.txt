### SUMMARY
Validates the functionality and UI correctness of a Characters page in a web application using Puppeteer for automated testing.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing of a Characters page by launching a headless browser, navigating to the page, and validating its structure, content, and error handling. It checks for console errors, page title, presence of UI elements (header, search field, role filter, add button), and absence of error messages. The test captures screenshots of both successful and failed states for debugging. The script returns structured results indicating success/failure and UI element presence.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testCharactersPageFix()**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including browser launch, page navigation, UI validation, error handling, and screenshot capture.
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript in the page context to check for dynamic elements or text content.
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to the Characters page with configurable wait and timeout settings.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures visual snapshots of the page (success/error states).
- **page.waitForTimeout()**: Introduces a delay to ensure page elements are loaded before validation.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node test-characters-page-fix.js`.
3. Verify results in console output, including screenshots in `checks/screenshots/`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses a local server (`localhost:8443`) for testing. Ensure the Characters page is accessible at this URL before running.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless mode (`headless: true`) may not display UI elements visually. Always verify results manually if UI issues are suspected.
