### SUMMARY
Identifies missing HMRS-specific drone implementations in a PyBullet-based simulation framework, detailing critical gaps between research requirements and current codebase.

### DETAILS
This document performs a gap analysis comparing HMRS research requirements with the existing codebase. While the simulation infrastructure (PyBullet) and learning system are operational, the code lacks specialized drones—**Scout, Tanker, and Overseer**—each designed for distinct missions (mapping, logistics, and safety). The analysis highlights missing capabilities like LiDAR, RTK-GPS, and real-time path planning for the Scout, heavy-lift systems for the Tanker, and quality inspection for the Overseer. Integration gaps in communication (ROS2/DDS), autonomy (swarm algorithms), and operational workflows are also noted.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Scout Mission**: Dynamic 3D mapping and obstacle detection with 10-minute pre-computation.
- **Tanker Mission**: Fluid/payload resupply or tether management (Option A: Mule; Option B: Lifeline).
- **Overseer Mission**: Quality assurance, bird deterrence, and real-time path verification.
- **Communication Protocol**: ROS2/DDS with low-latency mesh networking for drone coordination.
- **Coordination & Autonomy**: Swarm algorithms, collision avoidance, and dynamic geofencing.

### DEPENDENCIES
- PyBullet simulation framework
- ROS2/DDS middleware
- MAVLink bridge
- LiDAR/Depth camera emulation (e.g., Velodyne VLP-16/RealSense D455)
- Swarm intelligence libraries (e.g., PSO, consensus algorithms)

### USAGE
This document serves as a roadmap for implementing missing HMRS-specific drone components. Researchers should prioritize:
1. **Drone-Specific Hardware Emulation**: Integrate LiDAR, cameras, and GPS modules into the simulation.
2. **Mission-Specific Algorithms**: Develop path planning (Scout), resupply logic (Tanker), and QA protocols (Overseer).
3. **System Integration**: Ensure ROS2/DDS-compatible communication and swarm coordination.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Capability Gap
> The Scout drone’s **10-minute pre-computation** for path planning is not implemented in the current codebase, risking real-time performance bottlenecks during simulations.
>[!WARNING]- Integration Risk
> Without a standardized **ROS2/DDS mesh network**, drones may fail to communicate with <50ms latency, violating mission-critical timing requirements.
