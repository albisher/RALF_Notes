### TYPE
documentation

### SUMMARY
Describes conceptual plant types for alien ecosystems, ecological analogs, and speculative biology.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates a diverse range of plant forms, adapted to alien environments, ecological niches, or fictional biology. Each entry represents a unique evolutionary or functional adaptation, useful for worldbuilding, game design, or scientific fiction. The list spans terrestrial, aquatic, and extreme-environment flora, including both organic and non-living analogs.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Tree-like Form**: Dominant vertical growth for canopy structure.
- **Vine-like Climber**: Lianas or tendrils for support and nutrient absorption.
- **Grass-like Groundcover**: Low-growing, spreadable ground cover for biomass.
- **Carnivorous Plant**: Traps small organisms for nutrient acquisition.
- **Symbiotic Colony**: Hybridized plant-animal/fungi relationships.
- **Kelp-like Underwater Forest**: Aquatic photosynthetic structures.
- **Sentient Mobile Plant**: Slow-moving, possibly cognitive organisms.
- **Parasitic Plant**: Extracts nutrients from host organisms.
- **Bioluminescent Algae Mat**: Glowing surface coverings or colonies.
- **Crystalline Growth**: Plant-like mineral structures (e.g., non-biological).
- **Floating Gas Plant**: Buoyant, atmospheric nutrient-absorbing forms.
- **Lithophyte**: Rock-dwelling or consuming flora.
- **Thermo-flora**: Heat-adapted plants near volcanic vents.
- **Cryo-flora**: Ice-adapted organisms in cold environments.
- **Aerial Filter Feeder**: Absorbs atmospheric gases/nutrients.
- **Epiphytic Alien**: Parasitic growth on other plants.
- **Dominant Root Network**: Extensive below-ground or mixed systems.
- **Silicon-based Flora**: Non-carbon-based photosynthetic organisms.
- **Cactus-analogue**: Succulent-like storage adaptations.
- **Moss-analogue**: Surface-covering non-vascular ground cover.
- **Giant Fungi Colony**: Mycelial-based, often decomposer-like forms.
- **Floating Gas Plant**: Buoyant, atmospheric nutrient-absorbing forms.
- **Flowering Plant Analogue**: Reproductive structures in non-floral plants.
- **Crop-analogue**: Cultivable, resource-producing plants.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone conceptual classification)

### USAGE
This list serves as a reference for:
- **Worldbuilding**: Designing alien ecosystems or alien flora.
- **Game Design**: Creating unique plant-based creatures or environmental hazards.
- **Science Fiction**: Speculative biology or ecological systems.
- **Storytelling**: Describing alien flora in narratives or lore.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Ecological Diversity**
> Each type implies distinct evolutionary pressures, nutrient strategies, and interactions with other organisms. For example, carnivorous plants and filter feeders highlight adaptations to resource scarcity or novel nutrient sources.
>[!WARNING]- **Non-Biological Analogues**
> Terms like "Crystalline Growth" and "Silicon-based Flora" imply non-carbon-based or mineral-like structures—avoid conflating these with traditional organic plants unless explicitly designed as such. Clarify biological vs. non-biological origins in context.
