### SUMMARY
X3001 describes the **X3** resource-finding robot’s role in locating minerals and water for Space Peral’s colony.

### DETAILS
X3001 is a foundational **X-series robot** designed to autonomously scout for valuable resources (minerals and water) on Space Peral, critical for sustaining long-term colony habitation. It operates independently before the X2 naming convention was formalized, relaying findings to the communication robot **X11** for dissemination, though its data must be verified by **X2**. The unit employs advanced sensors (ground-penetrating radar, metal detectors, water sensors) and traverses rugged terrain, though its data analysis is constrained by 30-hour cycles and fluctuating energy levels.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Resource Scouting**: Detects minerals and water via embedded sensors.
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Navigates difficult environments (e.g., low-orbit/atmospheric conditions).
- **Data Relay**: Sends findings to **X11** for colony-wide awareness.
- **Sensor Array**: Rotating undercarriage-mounted array for terrain analysis.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (internal hardware/software only)

### USAGE
Operates autonomously in designated colony zones, triggered by predefined mission parameters (e.g., terrain type, resource priority). Requires **X2’s review** for accuracy before dissemination.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Role
> X3’s findings directly influence colony survival—errors in detection could lead to resource shortages or settlement collapse.
>[!WARNING]- Operational Limits
> Energy fluctuations and 30-hour cycles may cause intermittent data gaps; redundancy checks are mandatory.
