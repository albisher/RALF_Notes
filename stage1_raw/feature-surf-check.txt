### SUMMARY
Automated UI feature verification tool using Puppeteer to test webpage functionality and capture screenshots.

### DETAILS
This script automates UI testing by visiting predefined feature URLs, checking page titles, and capturing screenshots. It uses Puppeteer to launch a browser, navigate to each URL, and record visual results. The `CheckHelper` class logs pass/fail outcomes and generates a report. Screenshots are saved in a timestamped directory for debugging.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **FeatureSurfCheck.init()**: Creates a timestamped screenshot directory and logs initialization.
- **getScreenshotName(feature, description)**: Generates a unique filename combining date, counter, feature name, and sanitized description.
- **takeScreenshot(page, feature, description)**: Captures a full-page screenshot with error handling.
- **testPage(page, url, feature, description)**: Tests URL loading, captures screenshot, and records result via helper.
- **runAllTests()**: Orchestrates browser launch, test execution, and report generation for all predefined features.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, chalk, fs, path, config (local), check-helper (local)

### USAGE
1. Configure `./config` with base URL and Puppeteer settings.
2. Run script to execute all predefined tests.
3. Review screenshots in `./feature-screenshots/<date>` and report in `CheckHelper` output.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script handles browser cleanup in `finally` block, ensuring resources are released even if tests fail.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Non-existent URLs (e.g., `/nonexistent-page`) will trigger error screenshots and fail results. Validate all test URLs in advance.
