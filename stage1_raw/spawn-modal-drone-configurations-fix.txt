### SUMMARY
Fixes drone configuration loading for the spawn modal to ensure drone configurations are available immediately upon app startup.

### DETAILS
The `app-data.js` file contains logic for managing drone configurations. The issue was that the `droneConfigurations` array was initialized as empty and only loaded when navigating to the Config page, causing the spawn modal to display a message indicating no configurations were found. The fix involved adding a `loadDroneConfigurations()` call in the `mounted()` hook to load configurations silently at app startup, ensuring the data is available when the spawn modal opens.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **loadDroneConfigurations(silent)**: Loads drone configurations from the API with an optional `silent` parameter to suppress notifications.
- **mounted()**: Vue lifecycle hook that triggers configuration loading on app initialization.

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation/frontend/app.js`, `simulation/frontend/app-layout5.js`, `/api/drone-configurations`, `/app/data/drone_configs/drone_configurations.json`

### USAGE
To use this fix, ensure the `loadDroneConfigurations(true)` is called in the `mounted()` hook of `app-data.js`. The configurations are loaded silently, and the `droneConfigurations` array is populated immediately, allowing the spawn modal to display available drones.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Silent Mode
> The `silent` parameter in `loadDroneConfigurations()` ensures no notifications are displayed during startup loading, making the process seamless for the user.
>[!WARNING]- Reactivity Check
> Ensure Vue’s reactivity system properly updates the `droneConfigurations` prop in the parent components (`app.js` and `app-layout5.js`) after loading to avoid stale data in the modal. Verify the `mounted()` hook execution and prop binding in the browser console.
