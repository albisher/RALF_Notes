### SUMMARY
Tests dashboard data fetching and authentication workflow for a local API.

### DETAILS
This script performs an automated test of a dashboard display system by:
1. Authenticating with a hardcoded test user (`test/passtest`)
2. Fetching and logging dashboard statistics, world lists, and nested element details
3. Specifically examining the "Space Peral" world and its character elements
4. Validating the response structure and data integrity through console logging

The flow follows a sequential authentication → data fetching pattern with error handling at each step.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **authenticate()**: Handles API authentication using hardcoded credentials.
- **configureAxios()**: Sets up Axios with the authenticated token for subsequent requests.
- **testDashboardData()**: Orchestrates the complete data fetching and validation workflow.
- **main()**: Orchestrates the script execution sequence and error handling.

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, node.js (for console logging and process.exit)

### USAGE
1. Save as `test-dashboard-display.js`
2. Run with `node test-dashboard-display.js`
3. Expects API to be running at `http://localhost:5173/api`
4. Logs detailed console output of all responses

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Uses hardcoded credentials (`test/passtest`) for testing - not suitable for production.
> The script exits with code 1 on any error, preventing further execution.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Does not implement retry logic for failed requests.
> All console output is visible in terminal - sensitive data may be logged.
