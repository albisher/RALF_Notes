### SUMMARY
A Bash script to launch a live simulation environment using Docker Compose.

### DETAILS
This script automates the setup and execution of a live simulation of a quadcopter system. It sets up the environment by navigating to the parent directory of the script, then runs a Docker Compose service (`simulator`) mapped to port `5000` using a predefined Python script (`simple_quadcopter_live.py`). The script includes error handling (`set -e`) and provides user feedback via terminal output, including the simulation URL and instructions to stop it.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`set -e`**: Exits script on any error.
- **`SCRIPT_DIR`**: Determines the directory of the script for relative path resolution.
- **`SIMULATION_DIR`**: Resolves the root directory of the simulation project.
- **`docker compose`**: Executes the Docker Compose command to run the simulation container.

### DEPENDENCIES
docker, docker-compose, `simple_quadcopter_live.py` (Python script for the quadcopter simulation), `docker/docker-compose.yml` (Docker Compose configuration file).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to the directory containing `run_live`.
2. Execute the script: `./run_live`.
3. The simulation will start at `http://localhost:5000`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running. Ensure the `docker/docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured for the simulation service.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Stopping the simulation abruptly may cause data loss or resource leaks. Use `Ctrl+C` to terminate gracefully.
