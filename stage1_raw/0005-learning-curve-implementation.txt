### SUMMARY
Implements a structured learning progression for drone swarms, enabling incremental skill acquisition from basic hover control to expert-level precision tasks.

### DETAILS
This implementation defines a modular `LearningCurve` system where drones undergo a hierarchical progression of flight tasks. The system tracks performance metrics (e.g., altitude stability, waypoint accuracy) and advances scenarios based on success thresholds. The progression is divided into **Beginner** (hover/translation), **Intermediate** (precision/navigation), **Advanced** (formation/obstacle avoidance), and **Expert** (precision landing) levels. The `LearningCurve` class manages scenario execution, success validation, and automatic progression, while integration with drones involves worker drones executing tasks sequentially and a master controller adjusting difficulty dynamically.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`LearningCurve`**: Core class handling scenario progression, performance tracking, and success validation.
- **`start_scenario()`**: Initiates a new learning task (e.g., hover, waypoint navigation).
- **`evaluate_current_scenario(current_position)`**: Assesses drone performance against success criteria (e.g., altitude/position error).
- **`advance_to_next_scenario()`**: Moves to the next difficulty level if the current task is mastered.

### DEPENDENCIES
`swarm` module (for drone control integration), Python libraries (e.g., `numpy` for metric calculations, `matplotlib` for visualization).

### USAGE
1. Import `LearningCurve` from `swarm.learning_curve`.
2. Initialize an instance: `learning = LearningCurve()`.
3. Execute scenarios sequentially via `start_scenario()` and validate results with `evaluate_current_scenario()`.
4. Advance to the next level if success criteria are met: `learning.advance_to_next_scenario()`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Scenario Validation**
> Success thresholds (e.g., 20cm altitude error for hover) are dynamically adjusted based on drone capabilities, ensuring progressive difficulty.
>[!WARNING]- **Error Handling**
> Failure in intermediate tasks (e.g., waypoint navigation) may reset the learning curve unless explicitly handled in the master controller.
