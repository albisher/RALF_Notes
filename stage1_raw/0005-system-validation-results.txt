### SUMMARY
Validates system operational status post-Docker startup, including container health, backend API, simulation state, and drone functionality.

### DETAILS
This document records live system validation results after Docker containers were started, confirming core functionality. Tests verify container startup, health checks, backend API responsiveness, simulation state persistence, and drone spawning. Minor issues (e.g., command logging bug) are noted but deemed non-critical.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Docker Compose Startup**: Launches all required containers (`hmrs-session-db`, `hmrs-backend`, `hmrs-frontend`, `hmrs-simulator`).
- **Health Check API**: Validates backend API status via `/api/health` endpoint.
- **Simulation State API**: Retrieves loaded buildings and base position via `/api/state`.
- **Drone Spawning API**: Spawns drones (e.g., scout) with customizable positions via POST `/api/spawn`.

### DEPENDENCIES
Docker, `docker-compose`, `curl`, HTTP client libraries (for API calls).

### USAGE
1. Run `docker compose up -d` to start containers.
2. Execute health checks via `curl` to verify system state.
3. Use `/api/state` to inspect simulation data (e.g., buildings).
4. Spawn drones via `/api/spawn` with JSON payloads.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Minor command logging bug exists but does not impact core functionality. System remains operational with no critical failures.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure `localhost:5007` is accessible; port conflicts may arise if other services use the same port.
