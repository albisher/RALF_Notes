### SUMMARY
Describes various advanced eye and lens technologies for enhanced vision capabilities.

### DETAILS
This file outlines specialized optical and sensor-based eye descriptions, including lenses and vision systems designed for night vision, thermal imaging, wide-angle, zoom, infrared, and holographic applications. It covers both physical and simulated eye configurations, such as cyclopean (stereoscopic) eyes and multi-faceted designs, emphasizing modular and adaptive vision solutions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Night vision lens**: Enhances visibility in low-light conditions.
- **Thermal imaging lens**: Detects heat signatures for night/thermal applications.
- **Wide-angle lens**: Expands field of view for panoramic coverage.
- **Zoom lens**: Adjusts focal length for magnification.
- **Infrared lens**: Captures infrared light for night vision or thermal imaging.
- **Multi-faceted lens**: Mimics insect-like compound eyes for broad, high-resolution vision.
- **Holographic projector lens**: Enables 3D spatial projection for immersive displays.
- **Single cyclopean eye**: Simulates binocular depth perception (stereopsis).
- **Dual optical sensors**: Combines two independent vision systems for redundancy or enhanced data.
- **360-degree panoramic vision**: Full-circular field of view for situational awareness.
- **Infrared vision module**: Dedicated IR detection system for thermal/night vision.
- **Telescopic zoom eye**: High-magnification adaptive vision system.
- **Holographic projection eye**: Active optics for dynamic 3D rendering.
- **Thermal imaging sensor**: Direct thermal data capture for heat-based imaging.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Redundancy Note**
> Dual optical sensors or thermal imaging sensors may be used for fail-safe redundancy in critical applications.
>[!WARNING]- **Field-of-View Tradeoffs**
> Wide-angle and 360-degree systems may reduce resolution or dynamic range compared to zoomed/narrow-field lenses.
