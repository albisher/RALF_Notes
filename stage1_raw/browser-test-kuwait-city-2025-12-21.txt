### SUMMARY
Test report documenting browser functionality for Kuwait City GPS integration with OSM data visualization and viewer issues.

### DETAILS
This document records a browser test conducted on December 21, 2025, for a Kuwait City GPS application. It evaluates features like GPS location setting, quad view layout, OSM map rendering, and 2D/3D visualization. The report highlights working features (e.g., correct viewport display, OSM building loading) alongside critical issues (e.g., black screen in 2D top view, excessive log spam, missing view check logs).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`getOSMBuildingsForPlotly()`**: Converts OSM building data into Plotly-compatible format; called repeatedly causing performance bottlenecks.
- **`updatePlotsWithData()`**: Updates Plotly graphs with new building data; may trigger unnecessary conversions.
- **`logViewChecks('quad')`**: Logs completion of quad view checks; fails to appear in sidebar due to timing/logging issues.
- **Cesium 2D Top Viewer Initialization**: Fails to render map tiles due to missing error details in console.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Cesium.js (for 3D/2D viewers),
- Overpass API (for OSM building data),
- Plotly.js (for 2D graph visualization),
- Socket.IO (for real-time updates),
- `app-data.js` (centralized logging system),
- `osm-integration-box.js` (OSM-specific logic).

### USAGE
This test was conducted to validate GPS integration and OSM visualization in a browser-based mapping application. The report suggests debugging console errors, implementing debouncing for data conversions, and ensuring proper log visibility in the sidebar.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The **2D Top Viewer** fails silently with a generic error (`"Failed to initialize Cesium 2D top viewer"`). Investigate browser DevTools console for missing details like `containerDimensions` or `containerVisible` to diagnose layout issues.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The **excessive OSM buildings conversion loop** causes severe performance degradation. Debounce or throttle `getOSMBuildingsForPlotly()` calls to avoid console spam and memory overload. Check if redundant conversions are unnecessary before execution.
