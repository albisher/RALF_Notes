### SUMMARY
Describes key sailboat sail and structural components for optimizing performance across different maritime conditions.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the functional characteristics of various sailboat components, including sail types, mast configurations, and hull designs. The large sail is optimized for open-water navigation, while triangular sails improve speed in strong winds. Adjustable sails allow flexibility for varying conditions, and retractable masts protect against storms. Small sails enhance maneuverability, and stabilizing fins mitigate rough currents. The dual-hull design improves balance and stability, catering to diverse operational needs.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Large sail**: Maximizes wind capture for open-water efficiency.
- **Triangular sails**: Optimizes speed in high-wind scenarios.
- **Adjustable sails**: Adapts to changing wind and sea conditions dynamically.
- **Retractable mast**: Safeguards against storm damage.
- **Small sails**: Facilitates precise navigation and tight turns.
- **Stabilizing fins**: Reduces wave impact and improves stability in rough seas.
- **Dual-hull design**: Enhances structural balance and buoyancy.

### DEPENDENCIES

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Trade-offs
> Balancing sail size and adjustability impacts maneuverability and storm resilience—smaller sails improve tight turns but reduce open-water efficiency.
>[!WARNING]- Storm Risk Mitigation
> Retractable masts are critical for storm protection but may reduce sail area during calm conditions, requiring careful operational planning.
