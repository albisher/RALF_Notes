### SUMMARY
Document summarizes discrepancies between expected and observed behavior in Vue.js components across multiple pages, focusing on rendering and data fetching failures.

### DETAILS
This document provides a comprehensive comparison between code expectations and browser findings for Vue.js components across different pages. It highlights critical rendering issues where components are registered and data loaded but fail to render, likely due to incorrect `v-if` conditions or reactivity problems. Additionally, it identifies high-priority data fetching failures where API calls are not being triggered, resulting in empty data displays despite visible UI elements.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`fetchMLLearningData()`**: Function intended to fetch ML learning data from an API endpoint.
- **`v-if` conditions**: Conditional rendering logic for components based on `currentView` prop.
- **URL routing**: Maps specific URLs to component view states (e.g., `/dc` → `'drones-control'`).

### DEPENDENCIES
- Vue.js framework (for component rendering and reactivity)
- Vue Router (for URL-to-component mapping)
- API endpoints (e.g., `/api/ml-learning/data`)

### USAGE
This document is used for debugging frontend application issues by comparing expected behavior with actual browser behavior. It helps identify where component rendering or data fetching logic fails, particularly in Vue.js applications.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Component Registration Check
> Ensure components are registered and data is loaded before applying `v-if` conditions. Double-check that `currentView` prop matches the expected string (e.g., `'drones-control'` or `'analysis'`).
>[!WARNING]- API Call Missing
> Verify that `fetchMLLearningData()` is being called automatically on navigation to `/ml` and that the refresh button triggers the same function. Missing API calls result in empty data displays.
