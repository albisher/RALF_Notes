### SUMMARY
Test findings for verifying system monitoring page functionality after container restart and drone session operations.

### DETAILS
This document records a test session evaluating the system monitoring page’s ability to display session data, system status, and synchronization after a container restart and drone session interactions. The test confirmed container health, session creation, simulation progression, and UI responsiveness but identified routing and conditional rendering issues in the monitoring page.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`docker-compose down/up -d`**: Managed container lifecycle.
- **`New Session` button**: Created session with timestamp format `YYYYMMDDHHMM`.
- **`Start` button**: Initiated simulation time incrementation.
- **`Spawn` modal**: Displayed drone configurations (RGB, IR, Thermal, Polarization, LiDAR).
- **System Monitoring Page (`#/sm/`)**: Expected to show system status but rendered simulation interface instead.
- **Vue Router**: Likely failed to switch views based on URL hash.

### DEPENDENCIES
Docker Compose, Vue.js router, backend services (`hmrs-backend`, `hmrs-session-db`), frontend UI components.

### USAGE
To reproduce:
1. Restart containers via `docker-compose down/up -d`.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5007/#/sm/` and verify monitoring page loads correctly.
3. Test session creation, simulation, and drone spawning to isolate monitoring-specific issues.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Routing Issue
> The URL hash (`#/sm/`) should trigger a state change (`currentView = 'system-monitoring'`) in Vue Router, but the page still renders the simulation view. Check router configuration and component lifecycle hooks.
>[!WARNING]- Conditional Rendering
> The `v-if` condition (`v-if="currentView === 'system-monitoring'"`) may not execute due to incorrect state updates. Verify router middleware or component logic for view transitions.
