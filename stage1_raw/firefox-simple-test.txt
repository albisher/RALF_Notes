### SUMMARY
Automated Firefox browser test suite using Puppeteer to verify a web application's structure, content, and functionality.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch Firefox in a headless mode with specific configurations, then performs a series of automated checks on a local web application running on `localhost:8443`. It verifies the page title, existence of UI elements (sidebar, main content), loaded content, navigation structure, icons, JavaScript execution, URL correctness, and overall page structure. The test also captures a screenshot of the rendered page for verification. The script includes error handling and ensures proper cleanup of the browser instance.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **firefoxSimpleTest**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including browser launch, page navigation, test execution, and cleanup.
- **puppeteer.launch(launchOptions)**: Configures and launches Firefox with customizable options (headless, product, args, etc.).
- **page.goto(url)**: Navigates the page to the target URL with timeout and wait conditions.
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript in the context of the page to inspect DOM elements dynamically.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures a screenshot of the rendered page for visual verification.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Ensure the target application (`localhost:8443`) is running.
3. Execute the script: `node firefox-simple-test.js`.
4. Review logs and screenshot (`./screenshots/firefox-simple-test.png`) for test results.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script uses Firefox in headless mode with security-disabling flags (`--disable-web-security`, `--ignore-ssl-errors`). Use cautiously in production environments as these settings may expose security vulnerabilities.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` flags are required for Puppeteer to run on non-root systems but may reduce security. Avoid running this in untrusted environments.
