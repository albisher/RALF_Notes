### SUMMARY
Fixes applied to improve accurate session playback by correcting time handling, integrating visualization, loading context data, and preventing live updates.

### DETAILS
The fixes address critical gaps in the session playback system, ensuring accurate replay of drone trajectories and context data. The implementation resolves discrepancies between wall-clock and simulation time, integrates drone trajectories into visualization plots, loads essential session metadata (buildings, base position), and prevents interference from live updates during replay.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`updateReplayVisualization()`**: Updates visualization with trajectory data using `sim_time` instead of `timestamp`.
- **`updatePlotsWithData()`**: Displays replayed drone positions in 3D/2D plots with an `is_replay` flag.
- **`buildSessionContext()` (backend)**: Fetches buildings, base position, and orientation from simulation state/database.
- **`startPlotUpdates()`**: Skips live updates when in replay mode to avoid interference.
- **`clearReplay()`**: Exits replay mode gracefully.

### DEPENDENCIES
- `simulation/frontend/index.html` (frontend logic)
- `simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py` (backend logic)
- External libraries for visualization (e.g., 3D/2D plotting frameworks).

### USAGE
To use these fixes:
1. Apply the time field updates in `index.html` to ensure `sim_time` is used.
2. Ensure backend includes `buildings`, `base_position`, and `base_orientation` in replay responses.
3. Frontend must call `updateReplayVisualization()` to render trajectories and context.
4. Disable live updates during replay by checking `selectedReplaySession` in `updatePlots()`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Time Correction
> The switch from `timestamp` to `sim_time` ensures replay aligns with simulation logic, not real-world time. Misuse could cause desynchronized visualizations.
>[!WARNING]- Context Data Fallback
> If session data is incomplete, the backend defaults to summary fields. Override with fallback detection data to avoid missing buildings or base positions.
