### SUMMARY
Comprehensive list of hardware and software addons for the HMRS drone project, detailing specifications, documentation, and integration status.

### DETAILS
This document catalogs all required hardware components, including GPS/RTK modules and LiDAR sensors, for the HMRS (Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System) drone project. Each entry provides technical specifications, compatibility details (e.g., PX4/ArduPilot), and integration paths (e.g., UART/USB interfaces). The list prioritizes production-ready and open-source options, with links to official documentation and user manuals. The structure organizes addons by category (GPS/RTK, LiDAR) and notes their mandatory/alternative roles in drone operations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **CUAV C-RTK 9Ps RTK GNSS**: Provides high-precision RTK positioning for all HMRS drones, compatible with PX4/ArduPilot via UART/USB.
- **Here+ V2 RTK GNSS**: Alternative RTK GPS solution for HMRS drones, supporting Pixhawk and Pixhawk 2.1.
- **Velodyne VLP-16 Puck LITE**: Commercial LiDAR for THE SCOUT drones, offering 360° horizontal FOV and ±3 cm accuracy.
- **Ouster OS1/OS2 LiDAR**: Open-source LiDAR with ROS/ROS2 support, enabling cross-platform data processing.
- **Livox LiDAR**: Open-source LiDAR with ROS packages, supporting multiple models (Mid-40, Tele-15, etc.).

### DEPENDENCIES
- PX4/ArduPilot firmware (for GPS/RTK integration)
- ROS/ROS2 (for Ouster/Livox LiDAR SDKs)
- Python (for Ouster SDK installation via `pip install ouster-sdk`)

### USAGE
1. **Select Addons**: Choose between CUAV/Here+ for GPS and Velodyne/Ouster/Livox for LiDAR based on project needs.
2. **Integrate Hardware**: Connect via UART/USB interfaces (e.g., PX4/ArduPilot for GPS; ROS/ROS2 for LiDAR).
3. **Verify Compatibility**: Ensure firmware (PX4/ArduPilot) and SDKs (e.g., Ouster SDK) align with drone software.
4. **Documentation**: Refer to provided links for installation/configuration guides.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **THE SCOUT Mandatory**: The CUAV C-RTK 9Ps is *mandatory* for THE SCOUT drones due to its RTK accuracy and PX4 compatibility. Backup options (e.g., Here+) are available for other drones.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **LiDAR Power**: Velodyne VLP-16 consumes ~8W—ensure power supply meets IP67-rated requirements to avoid environmental damage. Ouster/Livox LiDARs are more power-efficient but require ROS/ROS2 setup.
