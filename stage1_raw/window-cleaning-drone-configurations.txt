### SUMMARY
System for programmatically generating, saving, and loading reusable drone configurations for window-cleaning missions, supporting both large and small drones.

### DETAILS
This system automates the creation of optimized drone configurations for window-cleaning operations. It distinguishes between large drones (capable of standalone missions) and small drones (specialized for task distribution). Configurations are saved as JSON files for reuse, enabling dynamic mission setup via programmatic APIs. The architecture includes preparer and spawner modules that handle configuration generation and execution workflows, respectively.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`WindowCleaningDronePreparer`**: Generates drone configurations (large scout, small scouts for mapping/detection/monitoring, and mission types).
- **`WindowCleaningDroneSpawner`**: Loads saved configs, creates simulation sessions, and spawns drones based on configurations.
- **`create_addons_from_config()`**: Dynamically creates addon instances from JSON configurations for sensors and equipment.

### DEPENDENCIES
Python libraries (e.g., `json`, custom drone simulation frameworks), external drone SDKs for sensor/addon management.

### USAGE
1. **Preparation**: Run `prepare_window_cleaning_drones.py` to generate configs (saved in `simulation/drone_configurations/`).
2. **Execution**: Use `WindowCleaningDroneSpawner` to load configs, spawn drones, and manage mission workflows.
3. **Customization**: Programmatically modify configurations via APIs to adapt to specific mission needs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Reusable Configs**
> Configurations are saved as JSON files, allowing easy reuse across missions. JSON format ensures compatibility with future updates.
>[!WARNING]- **Hybrid Limitations**
> Hybrid missions (large + small drones) may require additional coordination logic to avoid conflicts in sensor coverage or mission sequencing. Test hybrid setups thoroughly.
