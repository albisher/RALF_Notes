### SUMMARY
Tests a Python-based character generator using direct command-line execution with different seeds to verify deterministic output.

### DETAILS
This script verifies the functionality of a Python character generator (`characters.py`) by running it via `execSync` with two distinct input seeds (`test_character_seed` and `another_test_seed`). It checks:
1. **Hash-based generation** (output consistency for identical seeds).
2. **Deterministic behavior** (same seed produces identical character).
3. **Seed variability** (different seeds yield distinct outputs).
4. **Physical linking** (implicitly assumes the generator produces valid character data).

The script uses `child_process.execSync` to execute the Python script in a controlled directory, capturing and logging results. Errors are caught and logged for debugging.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **execSync**: Executes the Python script with input seeds via shell command.
- **path.join**: Constructs the absolute path to `characters.py` for execution.
- **console.log/error**: Outputs test results and errors in structured format.

### DEPENDENCIES
`child_process`, `path` (Node.js built-ins), Python (`characters.py` script).

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly in a Node.js environment.
2. Verify logs show deterministic output for identical seeds and varied results for different seeds.
3. Check for errors in `❌ Error testing character generator:` if execution fails.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes `characters.py` is in `Generators/Characters/` relative to the test file. Adjust paths if the structure differs.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> `execSync` blocks the Node.js process. Use `exec` (async) for non-blocking tests in production.
