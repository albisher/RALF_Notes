### SUMMARY
A script to remove task dependencies, enabling smoother workflows by unblocking tasks.

### DETAILS
This script dynamically removes dependency relationships between tasks in a task management system. It processes natural language or numeric task IDs to parse and execute dependency removal, ensuring pre-checks validate the operation’s safety. The script provides feedback on why dependencies were removed, tasks that become unblocked, and potential impacts on workflows. It includes smart analysis to suggest alternatives and warns about critical disruptions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`remove-dependency` CLI command**: Executes dependency removal via task IDs.
- **Natural language parsing**: Handles inputs like `"remove dependency between 5 and 3"` or `"unblock 5 from 3"`.
- **Pre-removal validation**: Checks dependency existence, workflow impact, and logical sequence risks.
- **Smart analysis**: Explains dependency rationale, verifies task executability, and suggests alternatives.
- **Post-removal reporting**: Updates task status, lists unblocked tasks, and adjusts project timelines.

### DEPENDENCIES
`task-master` CLI tool (assumed to be an internal dependency manager), Bash scripting environment.

### USAGE
1. Run via CLI:
   ```bash
   task-master remove-dependency --id=<task-id> --depends-on=<dependency-id>
   ```
2. Alternatively, use natural language commands like:
   ```
   remove dependency between 5 and 3
   ```
3. Follow prompts for confirmation and warnings.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Dependency Warning
> If removing a dependency breaks a critical path (e.g., task 5 depends on 3 for completion), the script will flag this and suggest alternatives to maintain workflow integrity.
>
>[!WARNING]- Unblocked Task Risks
> Removing a dependency may make tasks immediately actionable but could introduce new risks if the removed task was a prerequisite for others. Always review updated task statuses.
