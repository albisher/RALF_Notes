### SUMMARY
Automates visual design comparison between a static HTML sample and a running Vue.js web application.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to capture screenshots of both a predefined HTML template and a live Vue.js application across multiple pages. It generates a structured comparison report highlighting key visual elements like color schemes, layout, typography, and interactive components. The workflow involves launching a browser, taking screenshots of the HTML sample and each page of the webapp, then generating a markdown report with visual comparison guidelines.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **compareDesigns()**: Orchestrates the entire comparison workflow, including browser launch, screenshot capture, and report generation.
- **puppeteer.launch()**: Initializes a headless browser with custom viewport settings.
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to HTML/URL endpoints for screenshot capture.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures full-page screenshots at specified paths.
- **fs.writeFileSync()**: Writes the generated comparison report to a markdown file.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Save the script as `compare-designs.js`.
2. Ensure:
   - `sample01.html` exists in the `./preparation` folder.
   - The Vue.js app runs on `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Execute via Node.js: `node compare-designs.js`.
4. Review the generated `comparison-report.md` and screenshots in the root folder.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the Vue app is fully loaded before taking screenshots. Use `waitForTimeout()` to account for dynamic content (e.g., 2000ms for HTML, 3000ms for Vue).
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid running this in production. Puppeteer in headless mode (`headless: false`) may expose browser internals. Use `headless: true` for CI/CD environments.
