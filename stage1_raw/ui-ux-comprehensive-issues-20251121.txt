### SUMMARY
Comprehensive UI/UX issues report detailing resolved and minor problems in a web application’s layout, usability, and visual components across multiple stages.

### DETAILS
This report documents a systematic UI/UX audit of a web application (running on `http://localhost:5174`) conducted via browser-based visual inspection. It highlights resolved critical layout issues (e.g., equal column width distribution) alongside minor usability improvements needed, such as text truncation fixes and placeholder data refinements. The audit covers five application stages (Generate, Link, Card, Timeline, Story) and emphasizes production-ready status for major fixes while suggesting low-priority enhancements.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Column Width Distribution**: Ensured equal ~33% width across three-column layouts in all stages.
- **Timeline Visibility**: Verified adequate height (150px) and scrollability for the Timeline stage.
- **Color Scheme**: Implemented a consistent Material Design palette with good contrast.
- **Generate Stage Layout**: Maintained proper three-column structure with clear visual hierarchy.
- **Stage Navigation**: Confirmed all five stages (Generate, Link, Card, Timeline, Story) are functional with active state indicators.
- **Top Navigation Bar**: Validated world selector, create button, and user controls (e.g., Logout).
- **Column Header Text Truncation**: Identified truncation in headers across stages (e.g., "Available Cards" → "Availabl Cards").

### DEPENDENCIES
- Browser tools (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Web application backend (story elements data)
- CSS styling (for fixes like `text-overflow: ellipsis`)

### USAGE
This report is intended for UI/UX designers, developers, and product managers to prioritize fixes, validate production readiness, and address minor usability gaps. It includes screenshots (`20251121-*`) for visual verification and actionable CSS snippets for quick implementation.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Fixes
> All major layout issues (e.g., column width distribution) were resolved and verified through screenshots (`20251121-016`, `20251121-017`, `20251121-018`). The app is now production-ready for these components.

>[!WARNING]- Accessibility Gap
> Accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels) were **not tested** in this audit. Recommend formal testing to ensure compliance with WCAG standards.

>[!INFO]- Backend Dependency
> The Story Elements placeholder data issue may require backend validation. If placeholder data is intentional, consider adding a user-friendly message (e.g., "No story elements yet").
