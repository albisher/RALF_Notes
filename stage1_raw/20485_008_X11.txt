### SUMMARY
Log documenting a network integrity check for X11, assessing signal strength and interference across Peral Standard’s planetary network.

### DETAILS
This log records a **network integrity check** conducted on Sol 008 (year 20485) at the Central Communication Hub (31.0° N, 34.0° E). The check confirms operational functionality in all channels, with optimal signal strength near Blue City but significant degradation in the western highlands. The log notes a need for further testing in the highlands before declaring full safety, while energy consumption remains within acceptable limits. The task is to identify interference sources and optimize relay networks for full planetary coverage, with X5’s power deemed sufficient.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Signal Strength Assessment**: Evaluates performance in designated regions (Blue City vs. western highlands).
- **Interference Source Identification**: Focuses on root causes of degraded signals.
- **Relay Optimization**: Adjusts communication infrastructure for broader coverage.

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed (assumes pre-existing network infrastructure and X5 power system).

### USAGE
This log serves as a **post-check report** for network administrators to:
1. Validate current signal integrity.
2. Plan highlands testing.
3. Prioritize relay optimizations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Region
> Western highlands show **significant signal degradation**—requires immediate testing before full planetary deployment.
>[!WARNING]- Operational Note
> Current power from X5 is deemed sufficient, but long-term stability must be monitored for relay optimizations.
