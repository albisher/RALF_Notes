### SUMMARY
Unit tests for ROS 2-based drone interface box functionality.

### DETAILS
This file contains unit tests for `ROS2InterfaceBox`, a component that interfaces with ROS 2 for drone state and sensor data publishing/subscription. The tests verify initialization, publishing methods (drone state and sensor data), command reception, and shutdown behavior. The tests use `unittest` framework and rely on `ROS2InterfaceBox` from the `swarm.boxes` module.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`test_initialization`**: Validates correct initialization of `ROS2InterfaceBox` with node name, namespace, and publishing/subscription flags.
- **`test_publish_drone_state`**: Ensures drone state data (position, velocity, orientation) can be published without crashing if ROS 2 is unavailable.
- **`test_publish_sensor_data`**: Checks if sensor data (e.g., LiDAR points, camera images) can be published as a boolean result.
- **`test_get_received_commands`**: Confirms received commands are returned as a list.
- **`test_shutdown`**: Verifies graceful shutdown and deinitialization of the box.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, unittest, `swarm.boxes.ros2_interface_box`

### USAGE
Run via command line with `python test_ros2_interface_box.py` or import in a test suite. Tests assume `ROS2InterfaceBox` is properly initialized with required parameters.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Graceful ROS 2 Fallback
> The `publish_drone_state` and `publish_sensor_data` methods gracefully handle ROS 2 unavailability by returning `False` instead of crashing, ensuring robustness.
>[!WARNING]- Test Isolation
> Ensure ROS 2 nodes are not shared across tests to avoid interference. Use unique node names (e.g., `"test_drone"`) in `setUp`.
