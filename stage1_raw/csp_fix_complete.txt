### SUMMARY
Fixes Vue.js application CSP errors by updating Nginx CSP headers to allow `'unsafe-eval'` for development.

### DETAILS
This document details the implementation of a CSP fix for a Vue.js application that was failing due to overly restrictive Nginx CSP headers. The root issue was that `'unsafe-eval'` was missing, which Vue.js requires for dynamic evaluation in development mode. The solution involved modifying the Nginx configuration to explicitly include `'unsafe-eval'` in critical directives (`default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`) while maintaining security. The fix was verified via HTTP and browser tests to confirm the application loads correctly.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `nginx/nginx.conf`: Modified CSP header directives to include `'unsafe-eval'`.
- `docker-compose down/up -d`: Restarted containers with updated configurations.
- `curl -k -I https://localhost:8443/login`: Verified CSP header inclusion via HTTP request.
- `checks/simple-browser-test.js`: Created a Puppeteer test to validate browser compatibility.

### DEPENDENCIES
nginx, Docker, Docker Compose, curl, Puppeteer (for browser testing)

### USAGE
1. Edit `nginx/nginx.conf` to update CSP headers as shown.
2. Stop and restart containers with `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up -d`.
3. Verify fixes using `curl` or browser tests.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The `'unsafe-eval'` directive is only for development. In production, remove it and use a production-ready Vue.js build to eliminate CSP conflicts.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Overly permissive CSP headers can expose applications to security risks. Always balance security with functionality during development.
