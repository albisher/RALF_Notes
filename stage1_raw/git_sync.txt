### SUMMARY
Automates Git syncing (pull, commit, push) with error handling and logging.

### DETAILS
This Bash script automates Git operations to fetch, merge, and push changes to a remote repository (GitHub). It detects local changes, stages them, commits with a timestamped message, and pushes to the remote branch (`main`). The script includes conditional logic to handle cases where the local branch is behind or diverged from the remote, with appropriate warnings/errors. It logs all actions to `.git_sync.log` and exits gracefully on critical failures.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`log_message()`**: Logs timestamped messages to both console and a log file.
- **`git fetch`**: Pulls remote changes without modifying local state.
- **`git pull`**: Attempts to merge remote changes, with conflict detection.
- **`git add -A`**: Stages all local changes (including untracked files).
- **`git commit`**: Commits staged changes with an auto-generated timestamped message.
- **`git push`**: Pushes commits to the remote repository.

### DEPENDENCIES
git (Git version control), Bash (shell scripting)

### USAGE
1. Place the script in your project directory.
2. Run `./git_sync` from the project root.
3. The script will:
   - Log all actions to `.git_sync.log`.
   - Exit with `1` on critical errors (e.g., merge conflicts).
   - Exit with `0` on success or non-critical failures.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the local branch is named `main`. Change `main` to your branch name if needed (e.g., `master`).
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid running this script during active manual commits—it may overwrite uncommitted changes. Test in a backup branch first.
