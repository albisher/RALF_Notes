### SUMMARY
Defines scientific parameters for a drone swarm mission simulation, including positions, flight specs, and sensor capabilities.

### DETAILS
This file defines a `MissionConfig` dataclass containing all parameters for a High-Mobility Robotic Swarm (HMRS) simulation. It includes base and target positions, flight mechanics, sensor specifications, formation dynamics, and physical constraints. The `get_building_corners()` method computes all 8 corners of a rectangular building, while `get_approach_waypoint()` (incomplete) would distribute worker drones along the building face for coordinated approach.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **MissionConfig**: Dataclass holding all mission parameters (positions, flight specs, sensors, physics).
- **get_building_corners()**: Returns 8 corner coordinates of a rectangular building using its dimensions and position.
- **get_approach_waypoint()**: (Incomplete) Would generate waypoints for drone distribution along a building face.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, typing, dataclasses

### USAGE
```python
from mission_config import MissionConfig

# Initialize mission config
config = MissionConfig()

# Get building corners
corners = config.get_building_corners()

# Access parameters (e.g., max_flight_time)
print(config.max_flight_time)
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Building Corners Calculation
> Uses centered coordinates (origin at building center) to compute all 8 corners, accounting for width, height, and depth.
>[!WARNING]- Incomplete Waypoint Logic
> The `get_approach_waypoint()` method is cut off and lacks logic for distributing drones evenly along the building face.
