### SUMMARY
Validates character data consistency between frontend and backend APIs for a development environment.

### DETAILS
This script performs a multi-step verification of character data availability across frontend and backend systems. It checks:
1. Frontend accessibility via a basic HTTP request
2. Character detail page content presence
3. Backend health status
4. Character data availability in the main API endpoint
5. Character-specific data in the elements API (with element_type='character')

The verification specifically looks for character ID 289 across both data sources, logging detailed information about found data or errors encountered.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **verifyCharacterData()**: Orchestrates the complete verification workflow with nested error handling.
- **characterResponse.data.includes()**: Checks for basic character content in frontend response.
- **characterApiResponse.data.characters.find()**: Locates character 289 in the main characters endpoint.
- **elementsApiResponse.data.elements.find()**: Locates character 289 in the elements API with type filtering.

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, local backend servers at ports 5000 and 5173

### USAGE
1. Requires Node.js environment with axios installed
2. Runs against localhost endpoints (5000 for backend, 5173 for frontend)
3. Verifies character data consistency by checking both frontend display and backend storage
4. Outputs detailed verification results including success/failure statuses

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Character ID 289 is hardcoded for verification - adjust if testing different characters.
> The script intentionally logs 401 errors as expected for protected endpoints.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running this on production systems may expose sensitive endpoints during testing.
> Verify all endpoints match expected URLs before execution in production environments.
