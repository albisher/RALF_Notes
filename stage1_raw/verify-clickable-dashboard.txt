### SUMMARY
Automated dashboard clickability verification using Puppeteer to validate interactive UI elements.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a browser, navigate to a local web application (running on `localhost:5173`), and verify the presence and functionality of clickable dashboard elements. It checks for:
- Existence of the dashboard container (`.dashboard`).
- Count of stat cards and clickable cards.
- Text content for keywords like "Worlds," "Characters," and "Elements."
- Clickable navigation hints (e.g., "Click to view all worlds").
The script captures screenshots of both successful and failed states for debugging. It returns structured results indicating whether the dashboard meets clickability criteria.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **verifyClickableDashboard**: Orchestrates browser launch, page navigation, UI checks, and error handling.
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to the target URL with configurable wait and timeout.
- **page.$() and page.$$$()**: Selects elements by CSS selectors (e.g., `.dashboard`, `.stat-card`).
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript in the page context to extract text content.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures visual snapshots for debugging.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime.

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node verify-clickable-dashboard.js`.
3. Ensure the target app (e.g., a React/Vue app) is running on `localhost:5173`.
4. Output includes:
   - Console logs for progress and results.
   - Screenshots in `checks/screenshots/`.
   - Structured JSON results for programmatic analysis.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses headless mode for stability but may fail if the target app relies on non-headless features (e.g., browser-specific APIs). Adjust `--disable-web-security` flags cautiously for production environments.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer with `--disable-web-security` can expose the app to security risks. Use only in controlled environments (e.g., local testing). Avoid in production unless absolutely necessary.
