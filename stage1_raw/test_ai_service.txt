### SUMMARY
Script runs automated tests for an AI service, focusing on hash generation, Ollama integration, and rate limiting.

### DETAILS
This test script evaluates the functionality of an AI service by verifying its components: **HashGenerator** (consistency and uniqueness of hash generation), **OllamaService** (health checks, model listing, and rate limiting), and **AIService** (rate limit status, model availability, and world/content generation). The tests ensure deterministic behavior for hash generation across identical inputs and validate integration with the Ollama AI platform. The script runs sequentially, reporting pass/fail statuses for each test module.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **test_hash_generator**: Validates hash generation consistency and uniqueness for inputs like world names, user IDs, and related elements.
- **test_ollama_service**: Checks Ollama’s health, lists available models, and verifies rate limiting functionality.
- **test_ai_service**: Tests the main AI service’s rate limit status, model availability, and world/content generation (if Ollama is operational).
- **test_hash_consistency**: Ensures repeated identical inputs produce identical hashes and different inputs yield distinct hashes.
- **main**: Orchestrates all test functions, aggregates results, and exits with success/failure status.

### DEPENDENCIES
`ai_service`, `HashGenerator`, `OllamaService` (imported from `ai_service` module), Python standard libraries (`sys`, `os`).

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly (`python test_ai_service.py`).
2. It executes predefined test functions in sequence, printing pass/fail results.
3. Exit code `0` indicates all tests passed; `1` indicates failures.

### RELATED
[[ai_service.py]], [[HashGenerator class]], [[OllamaService class]]

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script dynamically appends the current script’s directory to `sys.path`, ensuring imports from `ai_service` resolve correctly regardless of working directory.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Skipped content generation tests may fail if Ollama is unavailable, leading to partial test results. Always verify Ollama’s health before running these tests.
