### SUMMARY
Document tracks implementation of high/medium priority drone system recommendations in HMRS simulation.

### DETAILS
This file documents the complete implementation of all high and medium priority recommendations from an integration ideas document, integrated into the HMRS simulation system. It details specific modules, formulas, and integrations for battery estimation, fluid calculations, time estimation, wind safety checks, path planning, mission state machines, and maintenance tracking across Scout and Tanker-Mule drones. The system now includes configurable safety buffers, overlap controls, and state-based workflows.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`ResourceEstimatorBox.estimate_battery()`**: Calculates battery requirements using suction, motion, and compute power over job duration with a 20% safety buffer.
- **`ResourceEstimatorBox.calculate_fluid_required()`**: Estimates fluid volume based on surface area and spray radius, with humidity correction.
- **`ResourceEstimatorBox.estimate_job_time()`**: Computes job duration via surface area divided by average volume, accounting for overlap percentages.
- **`WindSafetyBox.check_wind_safety()`**: Evaluates wind conditions (25 km/h limit) and provides safety recommendations for Scout drones.
- **`PathPlannerBox.plan_z_pattern()` / `plan_n_pattern()`**: Implements Z/N-pattern path planning for wide/tall buildings with configurable overlap and standoff distances.
- **`MissionStateMachineBox`**: Manages SCAN/PLAN/EXECUTE/VERIFY phases with state transition validation and history tracking.
- **`MaintenanceTrackerBox`**: Tracks area/time/mission-based maintenance cycles with alerts and recommendations.

### DEPENDENCIES
- `simulation/swarm/boxes/` (core resource estimation, path planning, safety, and state machine modules)
- `Flask` (for browser/container integration enhancements)

### USAGE
To use these implementations:
1. Import relevant modules (e.g., `ResourceEstimatorBox`, `WindSafetyBox`) into drone scripts.
2. Configure drone missions (e.g., Scout/Tanker-Mule) to integrate with `estimate_battery()`, `calculate_fluid_required()`, and `check_wind_safety()`.
3. Apply path planning (Z/N-patterns) and state machines via `PathPlannerBox` and `MissionStateMachineBox`.
4. Monitor maintenance via `MaintenanceTrackerBox` for automated alerts.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> All high-priority recommendations (battery/fluid/time estimation, wind safety) are now dynamically integrated into Scout missions, ensuring real-time adjustments based on environmental and operational data.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Overlap percentages in `estimate_job_time()` and path planning (`Z/N-patterns`) must be tuned carefully to avoid redundant operations or excessive battery drain. Default values (15%) are recommended but can be adjusted via configuration.
