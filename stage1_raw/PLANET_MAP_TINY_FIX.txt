### SUMMARY
Fixes issues with tiny/incomplete planet maps generated using hash "ew" by adjusting map dimensions, point distribution, and origin positioning.

### DETAILS
The fix addresses two primary problems: incorrect map dimensions calculated from cell clustering and insufficient coverage from uneven point distribution. The solution standardizes map dimensions to 1000x600, ensures full coverage via adjusted point distribution (60% uniform, 40% clustered), and guarantees proper origin positioning (0,0) for consistent display.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `createPreviewMap()`: Recalculates map dimensions to fixed intended values (1000x600) instead of derived from cell positions.
- `_generate_planet_points()`: Modifies point distribution to prioritize uniform coverage (60%) while maintaining clustered continents (40%).
- `mapInfoWidth`/`mapInfoHeight`: Ensures rendered dimensions match viewer expectations.
- `mapOriginX/Y`: Forces origin to (0,0) for accurate spatial rendering.

### DEPENDENCIES
`ui-beta/src/pages/MapGeneratorPage.vue`, `services/map-generator/engine/world_type_voronoi_generator.py`, Vue.js, Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`/`scipy` for Voronoi operations).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to `MapGeneratorPage` in the UI.
2. Enter hash "ew" and select "Planet" world type.
3. Trigger "Quick Preview" to verify the fix:
   - Map fills the full viewer (1000x600).
   - Cells cover the entire area without gaps.
   - Continents and oceans are balanced.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Dimension Hardcoding**
> Fixed `createPreviewMap()` to use predefined dimensions (1000x600) instead of dynamically calculated values, ensuring consistent sizing regardless of clustering density.

>[!WARNING]- **Testing Dependency**
> Restart the backend after applying changes to ensure updated Voronoi generator loads. Test multiple hashes to confirm consistency across different planet configurations.
