### SUMMARY
Documentation of test results for applied fixes in a simulation application, focusing on UI/UX and backend integration.

### DETAILS
This document summarizes test results for fixes applied to a simulation application, specifically addressing issues in the 2D viewer initialization and GPS preset selection. The tests were conducted in an automated browser environment, with fixes validated against Vue 3 and Cesium integration. The 2D viewer error details were improved to correctly handle Vue state access, while the GPS preset selection issue remains partially functional due to browser automation limitations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`osm-integration-box.js`**: Manages OSM integration and error details for the 2D viewer, updated to support Vue 3 instance structure.
- **GPS Preset Dropdown**: Handles selection of predefined GPS coordinates, partially functional due to automation tool constraints.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue 3, Cesium, browser automation testing tools

### USAGE
The document serves as a record of applied fixes and remaining issues for developers to verify and resolve. Re-testing is recommended for the 2D viewer initialization to confirm error details display.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Browser Automation Limitation
> The GPS preset selection issue may persist due to limitations in the browser automation tool not properly triggering dropdown selections, despite code fixes being applied.
>[!WARNING]- State Access Fix
> The 2D viewer initialization error details now correctly handle Vue 3 state access, but the underlying initialization may still fail—verify error details visibility post-fix.
