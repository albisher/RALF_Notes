### SUMMARY
Guide to drone simulation libraries covering battery life, position tracking, sensors, and energy profiling for drone autonomy systems.

### DETAILS
This document outlines key libraries and tools for simulating drone operations, including battery modeling, position tracking, and sensor integration. It provides Python-based solutions for energy consumption prediction (e.g., `drone-awe`, `pybamm`, `pyjoules`) and custom implementations for GPS/RTK and IMU simulations. The code snippet demonstrates a basic battery model for integration with simulation frameworks like PyBullet.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`BatteryModel`**: Tracks battery capacity, power consumption, and remaining flight time.
- **`update()`**: Adjusts battery state based on real-time power usage.
- **`get_remaining_time()`**: Estimates flight duration using current discharge rate.

### DEPENDENCIES
`drone-awe`, `pybamm`, `pyjoules`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `opencv-python`

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies via `pip install <library>`.
2. Integrate `BatteryModel` into PyBullet or similar simulation environments.
3. Use custom GPS/IMU implementations for sensor fusion (e.g., Kalman filters).
4. Profile control algorithms with `pyjoules` for energy optimization.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Battery Modeling**: `pybamm` offers advanced physics-based models but requires detailed battery chemistry data. Simplify for quick prototyping with `drone-awe`.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Sensor Fusion**: RTK accuracy depends on satellite visibility. Test under varying conditions to avoid drift in position tracking.
