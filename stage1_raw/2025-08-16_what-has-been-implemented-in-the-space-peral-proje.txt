### SUMMARY
Analyzes implemented features in the Space Peral project, focusing on frontend stores, backend APIs, and views to identify working and pending functionalities.

### DETAILS
The Space Peral project has implemented core frontend components like a hierarchical sidebar for asset navigation and RTL support for Arabic-first UI. Backend APIs for data export (JSON/PDF) and audit logging are partially functional, while features like plant generation, offline syncing, and real-time updates remain planned but unimplemented. The project’s progress highlights a focus on navigation and export capabilities, with gaps in advanced interactivity and data management systems.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **HierarchicalSidebar.vue**: Expandable/collapsible assets menu with LTR/RTL support.
- **Data Export API (JSON/PDF)**: Backend endpoint `/api/worlds/<id>/export` for document serialization.
- **AuditLog Model**: SQLAlchemy model tracking CRUD operations with timestamps and changes.
- **Plant Generation Backend**: Planned SQLAlchemy model and AI endpoint for plant data management.
- **Offline Sync Queue**: Frontend IndexedDB queue for queuing API requests during offline states.

### DEPENDENCIES
`vue-i18n`, `idb`, `ReportLab`, `OpenPyXL`, `python-docx`, `Flask-SocketIO`, `socket.io-client`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Vuetify`, `Tailwind CSS`

### USAGE
To verify implemented features:
1. **Frontend**: Test the sidebar navigation and RTL UI by switching locales.
2. **Backend**: Use `/api/worlds/<id>/export?format=json` to test partial export functionality.
3. **Audit Logging**: Check database entries for recent CRUD operations to confirm logging.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Frontend Priority**
> The `HierarchicalSidebar.vue` is a stable foundation for asset management, but plant generation and offline syncing require frontend implementation before full functionality.
>[!WARNING]- **Export Limitations**
> Current export supports JSON/PDF but lacks Excel/Word support, which is planned but not yet implemented. Ensure backend audit logs are tested for edge cases before full deployment.
