### SUMMARY
A structured classification of a star system’s lifecycle stages from formation to dissolution.

### DETAILS
This file outlines the chronological phases of a star system, detailing its evolutionary progression from early protostellar stages through advanced stellar phases, culminating in dissolution. Each phase represents a key transition in the system’s structure, composition, and fate, reflecting both internal stellar processes and external cosmic influences.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Proto-formation**: Initial collapse of interstellar gas and dust into a protostar.
- **Disk Formation**: Accretion disk around the young star, enabling planet formation.
- **Heavy Bombardment**: Period of intense asteroid/comet impacts post-planet formation.
- **Stellar Evolution**: Phases like Red Giant, White Dwarf, or Supernova driven by nuclear fusion.
- **System Dissolution**: Final collapse or dispersal of remnants (e.g., planetary nebula, stellar remnant).

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This taxonomy serves as a conceptual framework for:
- **Astrophysicists** studying stellar lifecycles.
- **Planetary scientists** analyzing system evolution.
- **Cosmologists** modeling galaxy formation and dynamics.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Transition
> **Disk Formation** marks the birth of planetary systems; critical for habitable zones.
>[!WARNING]- Unstable Phase
> **Heavy Bombardment** may erode atmospheres or disrupt young planets; variable duration (~400–1M years).
