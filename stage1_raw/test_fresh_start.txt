### SUMMARY
Tests backend API functionality for fresh start/reset operations, including backup and partial cache/database reset.

### DETAILS
This script verifies all available reset options and their execution through HTTP requests to a backend API. It authenticates using a test user, then tests:
1. Retrieving available reset options and current data counts
2. Checking current reset status (total items, data presence)
3. Creating a named backup of existing data
4. Executing partial resets (files only) with specific file type filtering
5. Performing a complete cache reset

The test uses a local backend at `https://localhost:8443` with disabled SSL verification for testing purposes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `get_auth_token()`: Authenticates with backend API to obtain an access token for authenticated requests.
- `test_fresh_start_functionality()`: Orchestrates all reset-related tests with detailed logging and result tracking.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, urllib3, datetime, os

### USAGE
1. Run as Python script to execute all reset functionality tests
2. Requires backend server running at localhost:8443 with test credentials
3. Outputs test results in structured format to `test_results` dictionary

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script uses insecure HTTP requests (SSL verification disabled) for testing purposes only. Production use should enable proper SSL verification.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The test uses hardcoded credentials ('test', 'passtest') which may expose sensitive data if not properly secured. Always validate credentials in production environments.
