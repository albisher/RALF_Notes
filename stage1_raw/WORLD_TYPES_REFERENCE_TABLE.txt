### SUMMARY
Provides a structured reference for procedural world type generation, including visual attributes, color schemes, and generation parameters for diverse environments.

### DETAILS
This reference table outlines the visual and procedural specifications for generating distinct world types, such as planets, galaxies, cloud worlds, and space structures. It includes background colors, key visual patterns, primary colors, and shape characteristics for each type. The document also details expected generation requirements, algorithms, and critical features to ensure accurate replication of reference images. Each world type is broken down into detailed visual specifications, color palettes, and procedural generation constraints.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **World Type Definition**: Classifies and describes each world type with visual and procedural attributes.
- **Color Palette Mapping**: Assigns specific color codes to each world type for consistent rendering.
- **Generation Algorithm Recommendations**: Suggests procedural generation techniques (e.g., Perlin noise, spiral arms) for each world type.
- **Critical Feature Validation**: Ensures key visual distinctions (e.g., organic coastlines, spiral arms) are preserved during generation.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone reference document; may integrate with procedural generation engines for implementation).

### USAGE
1. **For Procedural World Generation**: Use this table to guide algorithms when creating new world types, ensuring adherence to visual and structural specifications.
2. **For Visual Design**: Reference color schemes and patterns to maintain consistency in artistic assets.
3. **For Validation**: Compare generated worlds against this table to confirm compliance with expected characteristics.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Validation Check
> Ensure generated **planets** have **organic coastlines** and **distinct land/water separation**—failure to meet this may result in unrecognizable terrain.
>[!WARNING]- Algorithm Dependency
> Use **Perlin noise** for continents and **spiral arm generation** for galaxies; incorrect algorithms can produce chaotic or visually inconsistent results.
