### SUMMARY
Visualizes a globe using Three.js with dynamic height scaling and biome-based terrain rendering from external map data.

### DETAILS
This code initializes a Three.js globe visualization where geographic polygons are extruded into 3D terrain based on height values from a processed map file (`processed_map.json`). The globe includes interactive orbit controls, adjustable height scaling, and supports multiple display modes (e.g., combined terrain/biome rendering). Ocean/water biomes are forced to remain at or below sea level, while other biomes use color-coded terrain extrusion. The map data is stretched to cover the full 360° longitude span to eliminate gaps, with a base ocean sphere acting as a fallback.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`init()`**: Sets up the Three.js scene, camera, renderer, lights, and event listeners for dynamic controls (e.g., height scale, display mode).
- **`loadMapData()`**: Fetches and parses `processed_map.json` containing polygonized map data, vertices, and biome attributes.
- **`createGlobe()`**: Constructs the 3D globe by:
  - Validating map metadata (e.g., geographic bounds).
  - Stretching the map to cover full longitude span.
  - Extruding polygons into terrain with height scaling.
  - Applying biome colors (with water biomes capped at sea level).
- **`updateGlobe()`** (implicitly called via event listeners): Re-renders the globe when height scale or display mode changes.

### DEPENDENCIES
THREE.js, `processed_map.json` (external JSON file with map data), `OrbitControls` (Three.js addon for interactive camera controls).

### USAGE
1. Load the script into an HTML file with a container (`<div id="container">`) and input controls for `heightScale` and `displayMode`.
2. Ensure `processed_map.json` is accessible at the same origin or preloaded.
3. Render the globe by calling `init()` (typically via `<script src="globe.js"></script>`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dynamic Height Scaling
> The `heightScale` slider adjusts the extrusion height of terrain features proportionally to the base globe radius (1). Values >1 amplify elevation, while <1 compresses it.
>[!WARNING]- Water Biome Handling
> Water biomes (e.g., "Ocean") are explicitly capped at `heightValue = 1` to prevent over-extrusion. If `cell.t` (height) exceeds this, it will be clipped to 1.
>[!INFO]- Stretched Map Projection
> The longitude span (`lonSpan`) is forced to 360° via `stretchFactor`, which may distort small-scale maps. For precise geographic accuracy, adjust `lonSpan` dynamically or preprocess the data.
