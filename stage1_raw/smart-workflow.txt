### SUMMARY
A dynamic workflow executor that adapts to user command history, project state, and temporal context for optimized task management.

### DETAILS
The `smart-workflow` system dynamically selects and executes workflows based on:
1. **Command history** (e.g., `status`, `complete`) to infer intent.
2. **Project state** (e.g., pending tasks, blocked work) to prioritize actions.
3. **Temporal context** (time of day, day of week) to trigger time-sensitive workflows.
4. **User patterns** (e.g., morning routines) to personalize execution.

It composes workflows in four phases:
- **State analysis** (e.g., parsing `list pending` for backlog data).
- **Primary workflow execution** (e.g., triggering a standup script).
- **Follow-up suggestions** (e.g., recommending next tasks).
- **Environment prep** (e.g., setting up tools for coding).

The system also **learns** by tracking sequences (e.g., `status → complete`) and preferences (e.g., Friday workflows), adapting over time.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **ContextAnalyzer**: Parses recent commands/project state to determine intent.
- **WorkflowSelector**: Maps intent to predefined workflows (e.g., standup, sprint planning).
- **ExecutionEngine**: Orchestrates command chaining (e.g., `analyze → execute → suggest`).
- **LearningModule**: Tracks user patterns (time, commands) for future personalization.

### DEPENDENCIES
`command-history`, `project-state-api`, `time-context`, `user-patterns` (internal modules)
*(External: None, but may integrate with CLI parsers or task managers.)*

### USAGE
1. Trigger with `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., no args for default behavior).
2. System auto-detects workflow based on:
   - Last command (e.g., `expand` → complexity analysis).
   - Time (e.g., Friday → weekly review).
   - Project state (e.g., pending tasks → sprint planning).
3. Outputs:
   - Executed commands.
   - Follow-up suggestions.
   - Adapted environment setup.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dynamic Adaptation
> The system **learns** from your workflows (e.g., if you always use `status` → `commit` on Fridays, it will auto-chain them).
>
>[!WARNING]- Context Dependency
> If no commands are run, it defaults to **time-based** workflows (e.g., morning standup). Avoid empty inputs to prevent ambiguity.
