### SUMMARY
Summary of Space Peral world creation efforts, including successful API-based world setup, UI/UX testing challenges, and unresolved API errors for character and element creation.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the progress and challenges in developing a **Space Peral** sci-fi world with robotic inhabitants (X-Series) and biotic ecosystems. The project leverages a UI/API framework to create a colony world with unique environmental conditions (UV-filtering atmosphere, F-type star, and distinct biomes). While core world creation via API succeeded, backend API endpoints for character and element generation failed due to format mismatches, requiring debugging. UI automation (Puppeteer) also failed in Docker, necessitating manual testing via browser console. The document details planned content (robots, flora, fauna, structures) and next steps to resolve technical issues before completing the world.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **World Creation API**: Generates the Space Peral world via API (ID: 33, name: "Space Peral").
- **Character Generation System**: Backend endpoint (`characters.py`) generates deterministic traits for X-Series robots, separated from physical forms.
- **Element Creation API**: Handles creation of biotic/abiotic elements (e.g., plants, robots) but lacks validation for `type` field.
- **Writer Workspace UI**: Frontend component for asset creation, character preview, and manual UI testing.
- **Puppeteer Tests**: Automated UI testing suite (failed due to WebSocket/Docker issues).
- **Manual UI Test Script**: Debugging script for browser console testing (e.g., `manual-ui-test.js`).

### DEPENDENCIES
`backend/app.py`, `backend/models.py`, `Generators/Characters/characters.py`, `frontend/src/views/WriterWorkspace.vue`, Puppeteer, Docker, Node.js, React/Vue frontend framework.

### USAGE
1. **API Usage**: Authenticate via `http://localhost:5173/api` (test user: `test/passtest`), then call `/worlds` to create worlds.
2. **Manual UI Testing**: Access `http://localhost:5173`, open browser console, and run `manual-ui-test.js` to bypass API failures.
3. **Debugging**: Check `characters.py` for personality trait output format and `models.py` for element validation logic.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **World Foundation**
> The core world (ID: 33) exists but lacks interactive elements due to API/API UI failures. Focus on resolving `characters.py`/`models.py` mismatches first.
>[!WARNING]- **UI Automation Risk**
> Puppeteer tests are unreliable in Docker. Manual testing is critical until the environment stabilizes.
>[!INFO]- **Next Steps Priority**
> Fix API errors (character/element creation) before proceeding to UI integration. Verify persistence via database checks.
