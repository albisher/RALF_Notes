### SUMMARY
Manages computed properties for filtering and organizing drone simulation logs and communication data.

### DETAILS
This module (`VisualizationComputed.js`) provides computed properties for filtering and processing simulation logs, communication data, and filtering criteria. It implements logic for:
- Filtering logs based on time, phase systems, sender/receiver, and log types.
- Sorting logs chronologically (oldest/nearest first or latest first depending on mode).
- Extracting unique senders, receivers, and log types from communication logs.
The module relies on external state (`simulationLogs`, `communicationLog`, `logFilters`, etc.) and applies conditional filtering based on user settings like `timeTravelMode` and `disablePhaseFiltering`.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **filteredLogs()**: Filters and sorts logs based on mode (time travel vs. normal) and applied filters (sender, receiver, type).
- **simulationLogs()**: Extracts only drone simulation logs from a broader communication log.
- **uniqueSenders()**: Returns a sorted array of unique sender IDs from communication logs.
- **uniqueReceivers()**: Returns a sorted array of unique receiver IDs.
- **uniqueTypes()**: Returns a sorted array of unique log types.
- **isDroneSimulationLog()**: Helper method (assumed to be defined elsewhere) to identify drone-specific logs.

### DEPENDENCIES
`window.loggingPhaseSystem`, `this.communicationLog`, `this.simulationLogs`, `this.logFilters`, `this.timeTravelMode`, `this.currentTime`, `this.disablePhaseFiltering` (assumed to be injected or passed in).

### USAGE
To use this module, inject it into a component (e.g., a sidebar) and access its computed properties:
```javascript
const computed = new VisualizationComputed({
    communicationLog: [...], // Raw log data
    simulationLogs: [...],   // Pre-filtered drone logs (optional)
    logFilters: { sender: "X", receiver: "Y" }, // Example filters
    timeTravelMode: true,
    currentTime: 1000,       // Time to filter up to
    disablePhaseFiltering: false,
});
const filteredLogs = computed.filteredLogs(); // Returns filtered/sorted logs
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Time Travel Mode Logic
> When `timeTravelMode` is enabled, logs are filtered to only include entries with `sim_time <= currentTime` and sorted chronologically (oldest first). Otherwise, logs default to descending order (latest first).
>[!WARNING]- Phase Filtering Dependency
> Requires `window.loggingPhaseSystem` to be defined and functional. If missing, phase-based filtering will be ignored. Always validate this dependency before use.
