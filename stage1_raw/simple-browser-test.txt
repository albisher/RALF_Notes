### SUMMARY
Automated browser test using Puppeteer to validate a Vue.js application on a local server.

### DETAILS
This script initializes a headless Chrome browser via Puppeteer, navigates to a local application running on `localhost:8443`, and verifies the presence of a Vue.js application by checking for the `#app` container element. It logs success/failure states for each step, including browser launch, page navigation, and title retrieval. The test includes error handling and ensures cleanup by closing the browser in a `finally` block.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`simpleTest()`**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including browser launch, navigation, and validation checks.
- **`puppeteer.launch()`**: Configures and starts a headless Chrome browser with security/performance overrides.
- **`page.goto()`**: Navigates to the target URL with configurable wait and timeout settings.
- **`page.title()`**: Retrieves the page title for validation.
- **`page.$('#app')`**: Checks for the Vue.js root container element via XPath selector.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node simple-browser-test.js`.
3. Ensure the target application (`localhost:8443`) is running before execution.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `--no-sandbox` and `--ignore-certificate-errors` for compatibility with local development environments. Avoid these in production.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Localhost (`localhost`) may not resolve correctly on all systems (e.g., Docker containers). Test on the actual server IP instead.
