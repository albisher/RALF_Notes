### SUMMARY
A fully implemented enhanced UI testing suite for Space Pearl, ensuring robust functionality, error detection, and accessibility validation across all application sections.

### DETAILS
This implementation provides a complete framework for automated UI testing, covering authentication, navigation, content management (worlds, characters, assets), writing workspace, and export functionalities. The suite includes error detection for validation failures, network issues, and runtime errors, alongside performance and accessibility checks. Screenshot management with timestamped naming ensures visual verification, while a test runner aggregates results into detailed HTML/JSON reports.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`enhanced-ui-test.js`**: Comprehensive UI testing for all interactive elements (authentication, navigation, content management).
- **`error-detection-test.js`**: Validates form validation, network errors, JavaScript exceptions, and accessibility compliance.
- **`run-all-enhanced-tests.js`**: Orchestrates test execution, aggregates results, and generates structured reports (HTML/JSON).
- **`Screenshot Management`**: Captures full-page screenshots with timestamped naming for visual verification across all UI states.

### DEPENDENCIES
`jest`, `puppeteer`, `html-report`, `json-report`, `axios`, `cypress` (or equivalent testing libraries), `node-screenshot`, `chai`, `sinon`.

### USAGE
1. **Setup**: Install dependencies and configure test environments (e.g., browser automation tools).
2. **Execution**: Run `run-all-enhanced-tests.js` to execute all tests sequentially.
3. **Reporting**: Generate HTML/JSON reports for analysis via `run-all-enhanced-tests.js` output.
4. **Error Handling**: Review captured screenshots and error logs for debugging critical issues.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Test Coverage Depth**
> The suite prioritizes edge-case testing (e.g., long inputs, special characters) and ensures all form submissions trigger validation checks, reducing silent failures.
>[!WARNING]- **Environment Dependency**
> Network requests (e.g., API calls) require a live backend; offline testing must mock responses to avoid flaky tests.
