### SUMMARY
Automated frontend screenshot and metadata capture tool using Puppeteer for a local development server.

### DETAILS
This script automates capturing screenshots and metadata (title, buttons, inputs, links) of multiple frontend pages using Puppeteer. It initializes a headless Chrome browser, navigates predefined URLs, takes full-page screenshots, and logs detailed page information. Results are saved as JSON and PNG files in a structured directory.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **takeScreenshot(page, name)**: Captures a full-page screenshot with timestamped filename.
- **capturePage(page, url, name)**: Navigates to a URL, waits for network idle, takes screenshot, and extracts metadata via `page.evaluate()`.
- **runFrontendScreenshots()**: Orchestrates browser launch, page navigation, screenshot capture, and result aggregation across multiple endpoints.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`npm install puppeteer fs path`).
2. Update `BASE_URL` to match your local dev server.
3. Run script (`node simple-frontend-screenshots.js`).
4. Check `screenshots/frontend-pages` for PNGs and `screenshots/capture-results.json` for metadata.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses headless Chrome with disabled security features (`--disable-web-security`) for compatibility with local dev environments. Run in a controlled environment with proper sandbox restrictions.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid running this on production servers. The `--disable-web-security` flag may expose vulnerabilities. Use only for local development validation.
