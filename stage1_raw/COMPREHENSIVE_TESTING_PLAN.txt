### SUMMARY
A structured testing plan for validating procedural world map generation across diverse world types, ensuring deterministic outputs and visual consistency.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a systematic approach to test the map generation system by evaluating seven predefined world types (planet, galaxy, cloud world, space station, space ship, asteroid, moon). Each test case includes a descriptive hash, expected visual patterns, and analysis criteria to verify correctness. The testing procedure involves manual interaction with a web interface to generate and inspect maps, capturing screenshots for verification. The plan emphasizes deterministic behavior (same inputs produce identical outputs) and ensures world-specific visual characteristics align with descriptions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **World Map Generation**: Converts hash inputs into procedurally generated terrain.
- **Quick Preview**: Immediate visual feedback for map rendering.
- **WorldMap2D Viewer**: Displays and analyzes generated maps.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Records visual outputs for analysis.
- **Deterministic Validation**: Ensures consistent outputs for identical inputs.

### DEPENDENCIES
`http://localhost:5174/#map-generator` (web interface), backend procedural generation logic, WorldMap2D viewer library, screenshot capture tools.

### USAGE
1. Access the map generator via the provided URL.
2. Enter a descriptive hash for each world type.
3. Select the corresponding world type from the dropdown.
4. Trigger "Quick Preview" to generate and display the map.
5. Capture a screenshot and analyze the output against expected patterns.
6. Repeat for all test cases to validate consistency and correctness.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Deterministic Requirement**: The system must guarantee identical outputs for the same hash and world type combination. Any randomness in generation will invalidate deterministic validation.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Hash-Specific Variation**: While hashes should influence map diversity, extreme variations may produce unintuitive or unrecognizable patterns. Ensure generated maps remain visually coherent with their descriptions.
