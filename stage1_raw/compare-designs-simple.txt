### SUMMARY
Generates and compares visual designs by capturing a screenshot of an HTML sample and creating a static HTML version of a Vue app for visual comparison.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a browser, navigate to a local HTML file (`sample01.html`), and capture its screenshot. It then constructs a minimal static HTML representation of a Vue-based application UI (Space Pearl dashboard) with identical styling and structure to visually compare against the original rendered page. The script captures the rendered UI and saves it as a static image, allowing for side-by-side visual analysis of design elements.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **compareDesigns**: Orchestrates the entire workflow: browser launch, screenshot capture, and static HTML generation.
- **puppeteer.launch**: Initializes a browser instance in non-headless mode for visual inspection.
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to the local HTML file for screenshot capture.
- **page.screenshot()**: Saves the rendered page as a static image.
- **staticHtml string**: Contains the pre-defined static HTML template for the Vue app UI.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a Node.js environment.
2. Ensure `sample01.html` exists in the `./preparation` directory.
3. The script will:
   - Capture a screenshot of `sample01.html` and save it as `comparison-html-sample.png`.
   - Generate and save the static HTML version of the Space Pearl Vue app UI.
4. Compare the two files visually to analyze design differences.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the `preparation` directory exists and contains `sample01.html`. If not, the script will fail during screenshot capture.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The browser is launched in non-headless mode (`headless: false`), which may cause performance issues or display issues if the environment is not optimized for Puppeteer. Consider using headless mode (`headless: true`) for production environments.
