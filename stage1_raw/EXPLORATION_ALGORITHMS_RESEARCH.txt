### SUMMARY
Exploration algorithms research for autonomous drones focusing on 3D LiDAR-based mapping and optimal path planning, addressing vertical FOV limitations and altitude mismatches.

### DETAILS
This document analyzes root causes of XY-plane-only LiDAR detection (due to ±15° vertical field of view) and proposes solutions like asymmetric vertical angles, lower altitudes, adaptive scanning, and multi-level scanning. It details three exploration algorithms: **Frontier-Based Exploration** (currently implemented), which explores boundaries between known/unknown space by clustering frontiers and selecting high-information-gain regions; **Next-Best-View (NBV) Planning**, which optimizes information gain per viewpoint; and **Coverage Path Planning (CPP)**, which systematically covers entire areas. Each algorithm balances efficiency, adaptability, and computational cost, with trade-offs in local minima risk, revisits, and sensor constraints.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Frontier-Based Exploration**: Detects and prioritizes frontier regions for exploration, implemented in `FrontierExplorerBox`.
- **Next-Best-View (NBV) Planning**: Evaluates candidate viewpoints by information gain/cost ratio to maximize discovery efficiency.
- **Coverage Path Planning (CPP)**: Generates systematic paths for exhaustive area mapping, optimized for structured environments.

### DEPENDENCIES
LiDAR sensor data, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) libraries, path-planning algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT), and 3D occupancy grid mapping frameworks.

### USAGE
To apply these algorithms:
1. **Frontier-Based**: Use `FrontierExplorerBox` with LiDAR scans to detect and prioritize unexplored regions.
2. **NBV Planning**: Sample viewpoints, compute information gain/cost scores, and plan paths dynamically.
3. **CPP**: Deploy systematic grid traversal for full-area mapping, adjusting altitude/angles for optimal LiDAR coverage.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Vertical FOV Limitation**
> The ±15° vertical FOV restricts LiDAR to ground-plane detection. Asymmetric angles (more downward) or multi-altitude scanning can mitigate this by increasing downward ray density.
>[!WARNING]- **Altitude Trade-offs**
> Lowering altitude (3–5m) improves object detection but risks collisions or reduced coverage. Dynamic altitude adjustment balances detection and safety.
