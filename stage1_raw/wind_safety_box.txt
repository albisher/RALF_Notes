### SUMMARY
A wind safety checker module for evaluating safe drone operation based on wind speed and direction.

### DETAILS
The `WindSafetyBox` class implements a wind safety assessment system with two primary functions: `check_wind_safety()` evaluates whether current wind conditions are safe for operation, and `get_wind_effect_on_drone()` estimates how wind affects drone positioning. It uses a configurable wind speed limit (default 25 km/h) and converts between km/h and m/s for calculations. The class returns structured safety statuses with recommendations for different wind conditions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__(self, wind_limit_kmh: float = 25.0)`**: Initializes the safety checker with a configurable wind speed limit (converted internally to m/s).
- **`check_wind_safety(self, wind_speed_kmh: float, wind_direction: Optional[float] = None)`**: Evaluates if wind conditions are safe, returning a dictionary with safety status, speed metrics, and recommendations based on proximity to the limit.
- **`get_wind_effect_on_drone(self, wind_speed_kmh: float, wind_direction: float, drone_position: np.ndarray, target_position: np.ndarray)`**: Estimates wind-induced displacement between drone and target positions (placeholder function with placeholder logic).

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, typing

### USAGE
```python
# Initialize with default 25 km/h limit
safety_checker = WindSafetyBox()

# Check wind safety
result = safety_checker.check_wind_safety(wind_speed_kmh=20.0)
print(result['recommendation'])

# (Note: get_wind_effect_on_drone() requires additional logic to implement wind displacement calculations)
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Default Limit
> The class uses a default wind limit of 25 km/h, but this can be customized during initialization.
>[!WARNING]- Placeholder Function
> `get_wind_effect_on_drone()` currently lacks implementation for calculating wind-induced displacement—expand with physics-based calculations for drone navigation.
