### SUMMARY
A comprehensive guide outlining the implementation of an interactive drone simulation system, including battery life tracking, learning progression, and web-based control features.

### DETAILS
This guide documents the development of an interactive drone simulation system designed for swarm control. It covers key components like battery life modeling (`swarm/battery_model.py`), a learning progression system (`swarm/learning_curve.py`), and an interactive controller (`swarm/interactive_controller.py`). The system integrates physics simulation (`pybullet`), numerical computing (`numpy`), and visualization (`matplotlib`). The guide also details planned enhancements for a web-based interface, real-time adjustments, and scenario-based learning modes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`swarm/battery_model.py`**: Manages power consumption, energy tracking, and battery warnings.
- **`swarm/learning_curve.py`**: Implements 7 progressive scenarios (Beginner to Expert) with performance tracking.
- **`swarm/interactive_controller.py`**: Provides a web-based interface for real-time drone control (Auto/Manual/Learning modes).
- **`research/11-drone-simulation-libraries.md`**: Documents research on drone simulation libraries and priorities.

### DEPENDENCIES
`pybullet`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python`, `flask`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `drone-awe` (optional), `pybamm` (optional), `pyjoules` (optional).

### USAGE
To use this system, users interact via a web interface to control drones, monitor battery life, and progress through learning scenarios. The system updates live every 100ms, allowing real-time adjustments. For advanced features, optional libraries like `drone-awe` or `pybamm` can enhance battery modeling.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Real-Time Updates**
> The system refreshes live data every 100ms, enabling seamless interaction with drone behavior and battery status.
>[!WARNING]- **Critical Battery Warnings**
> The battery model includes alerts for low/critical battery levels to prevent unexpected shutdowns. Ensure monitoring is active in learning modes.
