### SUMMARY
Analyzes incomplete world type map generation tests, identifying critical mismatches between statistical data and visual outputs across multiple map types.

### DETAILS
This report documents a test suite for generating and validating world-type maps, where four out of eight tests failed due to persistent statistical and visual inconsistencies. All tested maps (Planet, Galaxy, Cloud World, Space Station) exhibited 100% land percentages despite expected varied compositions (e.g., 30–95% land/water), and visual renderings failed to display world-specific patterns (e.g., spirals for galaxies, modular structures for space stations). The root causes include incorrect height thresholds in statistical calculations, improper data passing between backend and frontend, and missing enhancement effects (e.g., fractal edges, erosion). The remaining tests (Space Ship, Asteroid, Moon, Solar System) were not executed due to navigation issues.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`map_generator.py`**: Handles statistical calculations for land/water distribution.
- **`WorldMap2D.vue`**: Renders visual representations of generated maps.
- **`map_validation_box.py`**: Manages height thresholds for statistical validation.
- **`MapGeneratorPage.vue`**: Passes map data and UI props (e.g., `backgroundColor`) to the renderer.
- **Enhancement boxes** (e.g., erosion, fractals): Apply visual effects post-generation.

### DEPENDENCIES
`services/map-generator/engine/map_generator.py`, `backend/boxes/generators/map_validation_box.py`, `ui-beta/src/components/common/WorldMap2D.vue`, `ui-beta/src/pages/MapGeneratorPage.vue`, backend logs.

### USAGE
To reproduce issues:
1. Run the map generator with predefined world types (e.g., "ew").
2. Compare statistical outputs (e.g., land/water percentages) with visual renderings.
3. Check backend logs for box execution failures or data corruption.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Fix Priority
> **Statistics Calculation**: Ensure `map_generator.py` uses consistent height thresholds for both validation and rendering. Verify alignment between backend logic and frontend display logic.
>
>[!WARNING]- Visual Rendering Block
> **Empty Backgrounds**: Confirm `WorldMap2D.vue` receives correct map data (e.g., cell coordinates, colors) and applies world-type-specific styles (e.g., galaxy spirals, space station grids). Browser console errors may indicate missing data or corrupted payloads.
>
>[!INFO]- Enhancement Debugging
> **Missing Effects**: Check backend logs for enhancement box execution failures. Test individual boxes (e.g., erosion, fractals) in isolation to isolate the issue.
