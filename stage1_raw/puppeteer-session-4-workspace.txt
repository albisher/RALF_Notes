### SUMMARY
Automated Puppeteer test script to validate and analyze a writer workspace application, checking for content, interactive elements, and screenshot capture.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a browser, navigate to a local writer workspace application (running on `localhost:5173/workspace`), and perform automated checks. It captures screenshots at key stages, extracts page content via `page.evaluate()`, and verifies the presence of workspace-specific keywords (e.g., "workspace," "Cyberpunk Neo-Tokyo 2087"). The script also inspects interactive elements (inputs, buttons, dropdowns) and logs findings. The results are returned as an object with boolean flags for detected features.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testWorkspace()**: Orchestrates the entire session, including browser launch, page navigation, content analysis, and screenshot capture.
- **takeScreenshot(name)**: Captures a full-page screenshot with a timestamped filename and logs success/failure.
- **page.evaluate()**: Extracts the inner text of the webpage body for keyword-based analysis.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`npm install puppeteer fs path`).
2. Run the script (`node puppeteer-session-4-workspace`).
3. The script will:
   - Launch a headless browser with custom Puppeteer options.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/workspace`.
   - Capture screenshots at three stages (workspace load, analysis, interactions).
   - Log keyword matches (e.g., "writing tools," "Cyberpunk Neo-Tokyo 2087").
   - Return an object with boolean flags for detected features.
   - Save screenshots to a `screenshots/session-4-workspace` directory.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the target application is running on `localhost:5173/workspace`. If the URL changes, update the `page.goto()` path accordingly.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Disabling security features (`--disable-web-security`) may expose the browser to security risks. Use only in controlled environments.
