### SUMMARY
Summary of Vue file refactoring efforts focusing on CSS unification and component modularization.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a Vue.js refactoring initiative that centralized CSS files and created reusable components to improve maintainability and reduce duplication. The refactoring includes consolidating color schemes, shared styles, and workflow-specific styles into dedicated files (`color-scheme.css`, `common.css`, `workflow.css`). New reusable components like `WorldSelector.vue`, `SettingsModal.vue`, and `CardGrid.vue` were developed to replace inline styles and modularize functionality. The `CardViewPage.vue` and `WorkflowPage.vue` files were refactored to adopt these changes, though further cleanup is required to eliminate remaining duplicates and inline styles.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Unified CSS Files**: Centralized color variables and component styles.
- **Reusable Components**: Created modular components like `WorldSelector.vue` and `CardGrid.vue`.
- **WorkflowPage.vue Refactoring**: Split large file into reusable components and remove inline styles.
- **CardViewPage.vue Cleanup**: Address remaining duplicate styles and hardcoded values.
- **CSS Convention**: Established structured CSS usage with scoped imports and CSS variables.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js framework, CSS modules (or scoped styles), Vue components library (e.g., Vuex for state management if applicable).

### USAGE
To apply this refactoring:
1. Import unified CSS files (`common.css`, `workflow.css`) in components.
2. Replace inline styles with CSS classes and CSS variables from `color-scheme.css`.
3. Replace inline component logic with new reusable components (e.g., `<WorldSelector>`).
4. Test components for functionality preservation after refactoring.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **CSS Variable Consistency**: Always reference variables from `color-scheme.css` (e.g., `--primary`) to maintain theme consistency across components.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Avoid Over-Extraction**: Splitting components too granularly can increase complexity. Prioritize modularity without sacrificing maintainability.
