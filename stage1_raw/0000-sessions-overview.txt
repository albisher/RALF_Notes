### SUMMARY
Provides structured documentation for session creation, drone types, and session management in simulation workflows.

### DETAILS
This file outlines the directory structure and key topics for managing simulation sessions, including drone-specific configurations and database-related processes. It serves as a central reference for session lifecycle documentation, covering creation, implementation, and verification procedures.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Session Creation Guides**: Documentation on how to initiate and configure new sessions.
- **Drone Type Sessions**: Implementation details for different drone types used in sessions.
- **Session Management**: Procedures for tracking, updating, and maintaining active sessions.
- **Database Sessions**: Handling session data storage and retrieval within the system.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Python scripts for session creation (`../../scripts/sessions/`), external libraries for session management frameworks.

### USAGE
Refer to this file as a reference for session-related documentation. Use linked files (`0001-drone-sessions-created.md`, `0002-drone-types-implementation.md`) for specific details on drone sessions and implementations. Follow session verification procedures documented in `verification/` for validation.
