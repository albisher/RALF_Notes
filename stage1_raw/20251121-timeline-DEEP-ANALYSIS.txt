### SUMMARY
Comprehensive UI/UX analysis report identifying critical layout, styling, and functional issues in a timeline page, including improper column sizing, excessive button width, and misaligned year markers.

### DETAILS
This report documents a **November 21, 2025** UI/UX deep analysis of a timeline page (`http://localhost:5174/#timeline`) with multiple critical issues. The analysis combines visual inspection and code investigation, revealing problems in column layout, time-scale selector styling, and year distribution. Key findings include improper CSS inheritance causing squeezed columns, an unconstrained dropdown button, and overly wide year markers due to a fixed `min-width` of 2000px. The report also highlights missed opportunities in debugging CSS, testing draggability, and validating design choices.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **TimelineStage**: Container for three-column layout; misaligned grid columns cause squeezing.
- **TopTimeline**: Hosts a time-scale-selector dropdown with no CSS constraints, making it excessively wide.
- **`top-timeline` CSS**: Enforces a `min-width: 2000px`, forcing year markers to spread excessively.
- **`time-scale-selector`**: Unstyled dropdown in `TopTimeline.vue`, relying on default browser styling.
- **`workflow.css`**: Contains critical CSS fixes for column layout and button sizing.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (for component structure), CSS (for styling), local development environment (for testing).

### USAGE
To address these issues:
1. **Fix column layout** by updating CSS to span parent columns (`grid-column: 1 / -1`).
2. **Constrain the time-scale-selector** with explicit width/positioning rules.
3. **Adjust `top-timeline` width** dynamically or to viewport constraints.
4. **Verify API operations** (e.g., event creation) and settings functionality.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical CSS Fix
> The `three-column-layout` parent grid should enforce `grid-column: 1 / -1` on child stages to prevent column squeezing. This requires browser verification of rendered styles.
>[!WARNING]- Design Preference
> The time-scale-selector button’s width may need user approval before finalizing CSS constraints, as it could conflict with design intent.
