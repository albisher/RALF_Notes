### SUMMARY
Describes architectural styles for pod house designs, emphasizing sustainability and innovative layouts.

### DETAILS
This document outlines five distinct architectural styles for pod houses, including organic, stacked, clustered, minimalist, futuristic, and eco-friendly configurations. Each style reflects different aesthetic and functional approaches, such as natural integration (organic), vertical stacking (stacked), communal grouping (clustered), clean lines (minimalist), advanced tech integration (futuristic), and eco-conscious materials (eco-friendly). Asymmetrical designs add unconventional flair.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Organic Pod House**: Blends seamlessly with nature using curved, earthy forms and natural materials.
- **Stacked Pod House**: Arranges units vertically in towers, maximizing space efficiency.
- **Clustered Pod House**: Groups pods closely together for communal living and shared resources.
- **Minimalist Pod House**: Emphasizes simplicity with sleek lines, open spaces, and functional layouts.
- **Futuristic Pod House**: Incorporates high-tech elements like smart materials, automated systems, and modular designs.
- **Eco-Friendly Pod House**: Uses sustainable materials, renewable energy, and passive design principles.
- **Asymmetrical Pod House**: Features irregular shapes and layouts for artistic, non-traditional appeal.

### DEPENDENCIES
