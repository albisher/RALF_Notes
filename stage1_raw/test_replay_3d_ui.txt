### SUMMARY
Tests 3D UI rendering of drone motion replays for validation.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing of a 3D UI feature by verifying if drone motion replays are correctly displayed in a 3D environment. It interacts with a local API (`http://localhost:5007`) to fetch session data, validate drone motion history, and confirm whether buildings and base positions are included. The script checks if drone movements exceed a threshold (0.01m) to ensure dynamic rendering, otherwise marking them as stationary.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Session Selection**: POST request to `/api/sessions/{SESSION_ID}/select` to load a predefined session.
- **Replay Data Fetch**: GET request to `/api/sessions/{SESSION_ID}/replay` to retrieve motion history, buildings, and base position.
- **Motion Analysis**: Computes Euclidean distance between drone positions to determine movement validity for 3D display.
- **Buildings & Base Validation**: Checks availability of static elements (buildings, base) in the replay data.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, numpy

### USAGE
1. Run the script to interact with the local API.
2. Verify session selection and replay data loading.
3. Check drone motion history for dynamic/stationary status.
4. Confirm UI integration by following the printed instructions (e.g., opening `http://localhost:5007` and selecting the session).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `numpy` for distance calculations between 3D coordinates. Ensure `numpy` is installed (`pip install numpy`) to avoid runtime errors.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> If the session does not exist or the API fails, the script exits with an error. Test with valid session IDs (`SESSION_ID`) to avoid premature termination.
