### SUMMARY
Summary of authentication fixes for resolving persistent 401 errors in a frontend-backend API integration system.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the root causes and solutions for authentication failures in a Vue 3/Vite application, where persistent 401 UNAUTHORIZED errors caused dashboard data to display incorrect counts. The issues included misconfigured Vite proxy, timing race conditions in auto-login, and conflicts between Axios instances. Solutions involved correcting proxy port mapping, improving auto-login logic, resolving Axios instance conflicts, and adding debugging enhancements.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `vite.config.js`: Proxy configuration for API routing.
- `auth.js` (Pinia store): Centralized authentication logic with shared Axios instance.
- `api.js` (services): Exported API client for consistent authentication headers.
- `Dashboard.vue`: Updated to wait for authentication readiness before API calls.
- `App.vue`: Enhanced auto-login flag and error handling.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vite, Vue 3, Pinia, Axios, Flask backend, PostgreSQL, Nginx proxy.

### USAGE
Apply the fixes by updating `vite.config.js`, `auth.js`, and `Dashboard.vue` components. Ensure backend services (Flask/JWT) and proxy (Nginx) are running correctly. Test with `curl` to verify API endpoints and proxy functionality.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The proxy target port was incorrectly set to `8443` in the original config, but the proxy container internally used `443`. Fixing this resolved connection refused errors.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure auto-login logic (`App.vue`) runs before dashboard components attempt API calls to avoid race conditions. Test with `localStorage` debugging to verify token persistence.
