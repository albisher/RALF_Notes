### SUMMARY
Removed redundant toggle button and optimized building load to prevent concurrent API calls and improve performance.

### DETAILS
This document details the removal of a toggle button for Plotly/OSM switching and the implementation of a load optimization system for building data. The toggle button was redundant since OSM is now handled via a dedicated left-side button, and Quad View defaults to Plotly. The optimization prevents multiple concurrent building loads by tracking a loading promise, ensuring efficient API usage and avoiding duplicate entities.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`loadOSMBuildings`**: Async function that loads building data with concurrency prevention.
  - Prevents redundant API calls by checking `_loadingBuildings`.
  - Uses a promise to track ongoing loads and waits if another is in progress.
- **`clearOSMBuildings`**: Clears existing building data before reloading.
- **`onToggleOSMView`** (in `app-data.js`): Internal handler for OSM toggle logic (still functional but UI removed).

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation/frontend/components/visualization-view-component.js`, `simulation/frontend/pages/simulation-page-component-layout5.js`, `simulation/frontend/app-component.js`, `simulation/frontend/app-data.js`, Cesium Ion/Overpass API, `nu` (likely a utility for clearing promises).

### USAGE
1. **Toggle Button Removal**:
   - Remove UI references to the toggle button in frontend components.
   - Ensure OSM toggle logic remains functional via `onToggleOSMView` (internal use only).

2. **Building Load Optimization**:
   - Call `loadOSMBuildings(latitude, longitude, options)` to load buildings.
   - The function internally handles concurrency prevention and cleanup.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Concurrent Load Prevention
> The `_loadingBuildings` promise ensures no duplicate API calls by checking if a load is already in progress. This prevents redundant data fetching and improves performance.
>[!WARNING]- Internal Logic Preserved
> While the UI toggle button is removed, the `onToggleOSMView` function remains active for internal OSM view toggling. Ensure backward compatibility if needed.
