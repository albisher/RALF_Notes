### SUMMARY
Fixes excessive HTTP polling causing slow responses and high server load by prioritizing Socket.IO updates.

### DETAILS
The issue involved redundant polling where Socket.IO events and HTTP requests were both updating data simultaneously, leading to `NS_BINDING_ABORTED` errors and degraded performance. The solution centralized Socket.IO updates to avoid redundant HTTP calls and reduced polling intervals to a fallback mechanism when Socket.IO is unavailable.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **updatePlotsWithData(data)**: Updates plots directly with Socket.IO data instead of making HTTP requests.
- **updatePlots()**: Conditionally skips HTTP polling if Socket.IO is connected.
- **updateDrones()**: Conditionally skips HTTP polling when Socket.IO is active, reducing polling frequency to 5 seconds.
- **plotInterval**: Reduced from 200ms to 1 second for fallback polling when Socket.IO is disconnected.

### DEPENDENCIES
Socket.IO library, AbortController (for request cancellation), WebSocket API.

### USAGE
1. Replace redundant HTTP polling with Socket.IO event-driven updates.
2. Conditionally execute HTTP fallback only when Socket.IO is unavailable.
3. Ensure Socket.IO listeners are properly integrated to avoid duplicate data processing.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Socket.IO must be properly initialized and connected before relying on Socket.IO-based updates. Ensure the `isConnected()` check is accurate to avoid race conditions.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Over-reliance on HTTP fallback polling can reintroduce performance issues if Socket.IO connectivity is unreliable. Always prioritize Socket.IO updates and minimize fallback polling intervals.
