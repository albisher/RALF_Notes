### SUMMARY
Fixes incorrect parameter type in map generator, ensuring biome data is passed as a dictionary for proper rendering.

### DETAILS
The `_assemble_map` function previously received a `List[Dict]` (biome_list) instead of a `Dict[int, str]` (biomes), causing the frontend to fail when rendering Voronoi cells. The fix ensures the biome data is structured correctly as a dictionary, where keys are cell identifiers and values are biome names. The `MapRenderBox` component was also updated to handle both formats for backward compatibility, extracting biome data from cells if not found in the packed data.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `_assemble_map`: Assembles map data from cells, biomes, and cities, ensuring biome data is passed as a dictionary.
- `MapRenderBox`: Renders Voronoi cells with biome colors and cities as red dots, with support for both dict and list biome formats.

### DEPENDENCIES
`services/map-generator/engine/map_generator.py`, `pack` (likely a module handling serialized map data), `List`, `Dict` (Python standard types), and frontend components (`MapPreview`, `WorldMap2D`).

### USAGE
1. Call `_assemble_map` with `biomes` (a dictionary) instead of `biome_list` (a list).
2. Ensure `MapRenderBox` receives the correct biome structure to render properly.
3. Test by generating a map via the frontend form and verifying the rendered output matches expectations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fix ensures `pack.biomes` is a dictionary (`{cellId: 'biome_name'}`) for accurate Voronoi rendering. If backward compatibility is critical, the `MapRenderBox` update handles both formats gracefully.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> If the frontend expects a list format, ensure the `MapRenderBox` logic is updated to handle both cases explicitly to avoid rendering inconsistencies. Test thoroughly with both input types.
