### SUMMARY
A research-enhanced tool to parse Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) with AI-driven task generation for improved accuracy and compliance.

### DETAILS
This script leverages an external research AI (e.g., Perplexity) to analyze PRDs and generate structured tasks by incorporating current best practices, technical deep dives, and compliance considerations. The enhanced mode refines task outputs with broader industry insights, including security, performance, and accessibility standards.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`parse-prd`**: Core function to parse PRD files and generate task lists.
- **`--research` flag**: Activates AI-driven research mode for enriched task generation.
- **`--input` argument**: Specifies the PRD file path for processing.

### DEPENDENCIES
`task-master` (internal CLI tool), `Perplexity` (AI research provider), Bash (execution environment).

### USAGE
```bash
task-master parse-prd --input=<PRD_FILE_PATH> --research
```
Run from command line with a PRD file path and the `--research` flag to enable AI-enhanced parsing.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Research mode dynamically fetches latest frameworks/standards but may incur API latency; cache results for offline use if needed.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> External AI providers may introduce bias or outdated data; validate generated tasks against internal compliance policies.
