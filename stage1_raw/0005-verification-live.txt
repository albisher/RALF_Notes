### SUMMARY
Verifies and documents the live quadcopter simulation server setup, including Docker, Flask, and PyBullet integration.

### DETAILS
This document confirms the operational status of a live simulation server running on port 5003, using Docker, Flask for HTTP streaming, and PyBullet for physics-based simulation. It details verification results for the container, HTTP server, simulation process, and image stream, ensuring real-time updates (10 FPS) are available via a browser dashboard. The setup includes a 6-panel dashboard with live visualizations like 3D/Top views, LiDAR scans, and metrics.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Live Simulation Server**: Runs on port 5003, serving real-time quadcopter simulation data.
- **Docker Container (`live-quad-sim`)**: Manages the simulation environment, ensuring PyBullet and Flask are active.
- **Flask HTTP Server**: Streams PNG images to `/stream` endpoint at ~10 FPS.
- **PyBullet Simulation**: Background physics engine generating frames for real-time rendering.
- **Background Thread**: Handles continuous simulation frame generation and refreshes browser at 100ms intervals.

### DEPENDENCIES
Docker, Flask, PyBullet, Python (for backend execution).

### USAGE
1. Access via `http://localhost:5003` in a browser.
2. Verify status with `curl -I http://localhost:5003` or `docker ps | grep live-quad-sim`.
3. Stream images with `curl http://localhost:5003/stream > test.png`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Ensure Docker is running before accessing the simulation. The container (`live-quad-sim`) must be active to generate real-time updates.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> If the browser does not refresh, check for console errors (e.g., CORS issues) or verify the container is running. A stale browser tab may cause delays.
