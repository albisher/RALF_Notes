### SUMMARY
Fixed quad-view hard refresh issues by ensuring Plotly plots initialize and update synchronously across all four views.

### DETAILS
The `prepareScene()` method was modified to conditionally enable OSM (OpenStreetMap) views based on layout mode. Previously, it unconditionally set `osmViewEnabled = true`, which caused 2D Top and 3D Isometric plots to fail initialization during hard refresh because `initializePlots()` checked `!this.osmViewEnabled` before proceeding. The fix ensures OSM is disabled in quad view, allowing all Plotly plots to initialize properly.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **prepareScene()**: Adjusts `osmViewEnabled` based on layout mode to prevent OSM interference in quad view.
- **initializePlots()**: Now initializes all four Plotly plots in parallel for quad view using `Promise.all()` to maintain synchronization.
- **updatePlotsWithData()**: Updates 2D Top and 3D Isometric plots in parallel for quad view to ensure consistent state.

### DEPENDENCIES
`Promise.all`, `async/await` (built-in JavaScript features), Plotly.js library (for rendering plots).

### USAGE
To apply this fix:
1. Ensure the layout mode is set to `'quad'` before calling `prepareScene()`.
2. Call `initializePlots()` and `updatePlotsWithData()` after `prepareScene()` to ensure all plots initialize and update synchronously.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fix ensures that `osmViewEnabled` is explicitly set to `false` in quad view, preventing OSM from interfering with Plotly plot initialization.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure `initializePlots()` and `updatePlotsWithData()` are called after `prepareScene()` to avoid partial initialization or out-of-sync updates.
