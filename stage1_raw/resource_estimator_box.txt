### SUMMARY
A utility class for calculating resource requirements (battery, fluid, time) based on mission parameters with safety buffers.

### DETAILS
This class implements a resource estimation system for mission planning, focusing solely on calculating energy and fluid needs. It processes inputs like power consumption and surface area to generate estimates for battery capacity, fluid volume, and operational time, incorporating a configurable safety margin for reliability.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **ResourceEstimatorBox**: Core class initializing the estimator with a safety buffer percentage.
- **estimate_battery**: Computes battery energy requirements using total power and job duration, then applies a safety buffer and converts to battery capacity (Ah) and runtime (minutes).
- **calculate_fluid_required**: *(Incomplete in provided snippet; would estimate fluid volume based on surface area and mission parameters.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, typing

### USAGE
Initialize with a safety buffer (e.g., `ResourceEstimatorBox(0.2)`), then call `estimate_battery()` with power inputs and job duration to get battery estimates. *(Fluid estimation would follow a similar pattern once completed.)*

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Safety Buffer
> The `safety_buffer` parameter (default 20%) is critical for Return-to-Home (RTH) missions—ensure it aligns with mission risk tolerance.
>[!WARNING]- Unit Conversion
> Battery capacity is calculated assuming a **12V nominal voltage**; adjust if using a different voltage system.
