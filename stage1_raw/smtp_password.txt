### TYPE
configuration

### SUMMARY
Stores an SMTP email password for authentication in a secure configuration file.

### DETAILS
This appears to be a plaintext password stored in a file named `smtp_password`. It is likely used for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) authentication, commonly required for sending emails via services like Gmail, Outlook, or other email providers. The password is hashed or encoded in the filename (`gW9gINB56svchMCnUF1Dgmtk9IzUfVW`), which may be a placeholder or obfuscation technique. This file should be handled with extreme caution due to security risks if exposed.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`smtp_password`**: Contains the raw SMTP authentication password for email services.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone plaintext file)

### USAGE
This file should be used in conjunction with an SMTP client library or application that retrieves the password dynamically (e.g., via environment variables or secure configuration systems) rather than hardcoding it. Never commit this file to version control or expose it in public repositories.

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!WARNING]- Security Risk
> Exposing this file in any form (e.g., GitHub, local storage, or logs) could lead to unauthorized email account access. Always use secure storage (e.g., encrypted files, secrets managers) for credentials.
>[!INFO]- Obfuscation Note
> The filename suggests a hashed or encoded format, but the content is still plaintext. If this is part of a larger system, verify the intended security layer (e.g., encryption, key derivation).
