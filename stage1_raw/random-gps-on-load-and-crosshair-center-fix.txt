### SUMMARY
Fixed application initialization to generate random MENA GPS locations and replaced the green arrow marker with a crosshair for better visual clarity.

### DETAILS
This fix addresses two critical issues: ensuring random GPS coordinates are generated on application load from a predefined MENA cities list, and replacing the green arrow marker with a crosshair (two orthogonal lines) for improved visual feedback in both OSM (Cesium) and Plotly views. The randomization logic now occurs during initialization, guaranteeing varied locations per session.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `__init__` in `HMRSSimulationLive`: Implements random GPS generation on startup by selecting a city from a MENA list and applying random offsets.
- Crosshair polyline creation (JavaScript): Uses two polylines (vertical/horizontal) with lime color and transparency to form a centered crosshair in Cesium/Plotly environments.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Python libraries: `random` (for city selection and offset generation)
- Web libraries: Cesium.js (for OSM visualization), Plotly (for alternative visualization)
- External data: MENA cities JSON list (hardcoded in code snippet)

### USAGE
To use this fix:
1. Replace the old GPS initialization logic with the randomized version in `HMRSSimulationLive.__init__`.
2. Remove the green arrow billboard and integrate the crosshair polylines in Cesium/Plotly views.
3. Ensure the MENA cities list is maintained and updated if new cities are added.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Initialization Change
> The `set_base_gps()` call now includes `is_random=True` to track randomized locations, which may require UI updates to reflect this state.
>[!WARNING]- Visual Consistency
> Crosshair must be rendered above all other elements (e.g., billboards) to ensure visibility. Adjust `disableDepthTestDistance` if layers overlap.
