### SUMMARY
Validates a Vue.js application's HTTP endpoints, checks for Vue-specific components, and saves HTML responses for inspection.

### DETAILS
This script performs automated HTTP tests on a Vue.js application running on `localhost:8443`. It verifies the main application page, Vite client, `main.ts` entry point, and an API health endpoint. The script also analyzes the HTML response for Vue-specific markers (e.g., `id="app"`, `Vite App` title) and saves the raw HTML response to a timestamped file for debugging. The `makeHTTPRequest` function handles HTTPS requests with a timeout to avoid hanging.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`vueAppHTTPTest()`**: Orchestrates the entire test suite, logging results for each endpoint and analysis.
- **`makeHTTPRequest(path)`**: Asynchronous function that sends HTTP GET requests to `localhost:8443` and resolves with a structured response object (status code, headers, body).

### DEPENDENCIES
`https`, `fs` (Node.js built-ins), no external libraries.

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly in a Node.js environment (e.g., `node vue-app-http-test.js`).
2. Ensure the Vue.js app is running on `localhost:8443` with HTTPS enabled.
3. The script logs test results and saves the main HTML response to `screenshots/vue-app-html-{timestamp}.html`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `rejectUnauthorized: false` in `https.request()` to bypass SSL certificate validation for local testing. Use this cautiously in production.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The `main.ts` endpoint may not exist if the app uses a different entry file (e.g., `main.js`). Adjust the path if needed.
