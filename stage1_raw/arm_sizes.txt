### SUMMARY
Defines a simple enumeration of size categories for ARM-related dimensions or classifications.

### DETAILS
This appears to be a basic list of predefined size labels (`Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `Gigantic`, `Compact`) likely used for categorizing ARM-related components, hardware, or software attributes (e.g., memory allocation, architecture scaling, or design constraints). The terms suggest a tiered system for classification, possibly tied to performance, storage, or computational capacity.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
*(None explicitly defined—likely a static list or lookup table.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This could be used in:
- A configuration system to dynamically assign size-based logic (e.g., memory allocation, hardware selection).
- A documentation or design decision table for ARM architecture scaling.
- A utility function to validate or map size inputs (e.g., `if size in ["Small", "Medium"]`).

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Note
> These terms may correlate with ARM’s **ARMv8-A** architecture’s **memory size limits** (e.g., `Small` for 32-bit, `Large` for 64-bit), but this is speculative without additional code. Verify usage in the broader system.
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity Warning
> Terms like `Gigantic` and `Compact` lack standardized definitions—ensure consistency with project-specific conventions.
