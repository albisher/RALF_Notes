### SUMMARY
Automated UI testing script for verifying assets page functionality using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing of an application's assets refactor by:
1. Launching a browser instance with Puppeteer
2. Navigating through the application's landing page, assets page, and asset detail pages
3. Verifying UI elements like asset cards, navigation links, and sidebar functionality
4. Testing asset creation workflow with dialog handling
5. Capturing screenshots at each step for visual verification
6. Handling errors gracefully with error screenshot capture

The test follows a structured sequence: landing page → assets page → asset detail → sidebar navigation → asset creation, with visual verification at each stage.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `testAssetsRefactor()`: Main async function that orchestrates the entire test workflow.
- `puppeteer.launch()`: Initializes browser instance with customizable settings.
- `page.goto()`: Navigates to different application pages with network idle waiting.
- `page.screenshot()`: Captures visual snapshots at each test stage.
- `page.$eval()`: Extracts text content from page elements.
- `page.$()`: Selects DOM elements for interaction.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer fs path`
2. Run the script: `node test-assets-refactor.js`
3. The test will:
   - Launch browser
   - Capture screenshots at each step
   - Log progress and verify functionality
   - Save error screenshots if any occur
   - Automatically close browser

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes the application is running on `http://localhost:5173`. Modify the URLs if testing a different environment.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The script runs in non-headless mode (`headless: false`) for visual verification. Ensure your environment allows this configuration. Consider adding timeout limits for long-running operations.
