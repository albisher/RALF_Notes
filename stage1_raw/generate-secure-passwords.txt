### SUMMARY
Generates secure passwords and secret keys for a software project using OpenSSL, then creates a `.env` file for deployment.

### DETAILS
This script leverages OpenSSL to produce cryptographically strong passwords and keys (32–64 characters) for various security-sensitive components (JWT, databases, API keys). It dynamically constructs a `.env` file with placeholder values for sensitive credentials, enforces strict file permissions (`600`), and provides colored feedback via `print_status()`. The script checks for OpenSSL availability and exits with an error if missing. It also includes security warnings about secure storage and rotation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`print_status()`**: Displays colored status messages (SUCCESS, ERROR, WARNING, INFO).
- **`generate_password()`**: Creates a 32-character password using `openssl rand -base64` (filtered to exclude `=+/`).
- **`generate_secret_key()`**: Generates a 64-character hexadecimal key with `openssl rand -hex`.
- **`.env file creation**: Populates environment variables for JWT, databases (PostgreSQL/OpenProject/n8n), and APIs with auto-filled secrets.

### DEPENDENCIES
`openssl`, `bash` (standard libraries), `date` (for timestamp in `.env`).

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a terminal:
   ```bash
   chmod +x generate-secure-passwords.sh
   ./generate-secure-passwords.sh
   ```
2. Copy the generated `.env` file into your project directory.
3. Replace placeholder API keys (`your-perplexity-api-key-here`) with actual values.
4. Use the script in CI/CD pipelines or deployment workflows.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Never commit `.env` to version control**—it contains all generated secrets. Use `.gitignore` to exclude it.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Test passwords in a staging environment** before production deployment. Rotate keys periodically to mitigate risk.
