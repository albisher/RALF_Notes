### SUMMARY
Automates creation of a custom sci-fi world and associated X-Series robots in a web-based game environment using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to automate interactions with a web application (likely a space-themed game or simulation) to:
1. Launch a browser, navigate to the worlds page, and capture initial screenshots.
2. Create a custom world named "Space Peral" with detailed descriptions of its environment.
3. Navigate to the newly created world and capture its details.
4. Automate the creation of six specialized X-Series robots (e.g., Drone, Orchestrator) with predefined roles, descriptions, and locations.
The script employs Puppeteer’s `evaluateHandle` and `page.$` methods to dynamically locate and interact with UI elements, including buttons, inputs, and text fields.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **createSpacePeralWorld()**: Orchestrates the entire workflow of world creation and robot setup.
- **createRobot(page, name, role, description)**: Helper function to dynamically create and configure individual X-Series robots with custom attributes.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node create-space-peral-world.js`.
3. Ensure the target web application (e.g., game) is running locally on `http://localhost:5173/worlds`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the target application uses standard HTML/CSS selectors for UI elements. If the DOM structure changes, selectors may need adjustment.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer in non-headless mode (`--no-sandbox`) may expose security risks on certain systems. Use with caution in restricted environments.
