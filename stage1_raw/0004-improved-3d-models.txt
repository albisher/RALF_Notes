### SUMMARY
Enhanced 3D model representations for PyBullet simulation, improving realism with detailed drones, trucks, and buildings.

### DETAILS
This file details improvements to 3D models in a PyBullet simulation environment, replacing basic geometric shapes with realistic representations. The enhancements include:
- **Quadcopter drones** with body, propellers, and physics constraints.
- **Base trucks** with cab, cargo area, and wheels for accurate vehicle modeling.
- **20-story buildings** with window grids and static structural details.

Models are implemented via `ModelLoader` class in `swarm/model_loader.py`, supporting customizable properties like scale, color, and position.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`create_quadcopter_drone()`**: Creates a detailed quadcopter drone with configurable physics and visual properties.
- **`create_base_truck()`**: Builds a realistic truck model with cab, cargo, and wheels.
- **`create_building()`**: Generates a 3D building with configurable dimensions, window grids, and static structure.

### DEPENDENCIES
PyBullet, URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), custom `swarm` package (model_loader module).

### USAGE
Initialize `ModelLoader` with a PyBullet physics client, then call methods to instantiate models with customizable parameters (e.g., position, scale, color).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Physics Constraints
> Propellers in drones are visually linked to the body but do not collide, ensuring smooth movement while maintaining realism.
>[!WARNING]- Static Models
> Trucks and buildings are static; avoid dynamic physics interactions unless explicitly configured.
