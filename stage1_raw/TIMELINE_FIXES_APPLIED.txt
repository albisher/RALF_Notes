### SUMMARY
Documentation summarizing fixes for critical issues in a Vue.js timeline component, improving timing, reactivity, and code organization.

### DETAILS
This document details five key fixes applied to a Vue.js component (`TopTimeline.vue`) to resolve issues related to timing, race conditions, and inefficient logic. The fixes centralize year extraction logic, eliminate hacks like `setTimeout`, and enhance reactivity with proper watchers and loading states. The refactoring ensures the year scale updates correctly after card loading and prevents redundant computations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`extractYearsFromCards()`**: Centralized method for extracting years from cards, now guarded by loading state to prevent race conditions.
- **`watch: cards` handler**: Reactive watcher that triggers extraction after `$nextTick` to ensure cards are loaded.
- **`yearMarkers()` (computed)**: Pure computed property that relies on pre-extracted years, avoiding side effects.
- **`isLoadingYears`/`yearsExtracted`**: State flags to track extraction progress and prevent concurrent operations.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (3.x), Vuex (if applicable for state management), Vuex devtools (for debugging reactivity).

### USAGE
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `YearExtractionBox` and ensure `cards` data is reactive.
2. **Trigger Extraction**: Use the centralized `extractYearsFromCards()` method when cards or markers change.
3. **Reactivity**: Leverage Vue’s reactivity system with `watch` and `computed` to maintain state consistency.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Timing Fix**
> The removal of `setTimeout` ensures the year scale appears immediately after cards load, eliminating visual delays. The `$nextTick` wrapper guarantees cards are fully rendered before extraction.

>[!WARNING]- **Loading State Protection**
> The `isLoadingYears` flag prevents race conditions by blocking concurrent extractions, improving UI responsiveness and avoiding errors during rapid data changes.
