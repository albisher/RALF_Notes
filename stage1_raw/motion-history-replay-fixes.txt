### SUMMARY
Fixes applied to ensure motion history is properly saved, loaded, and reflects drone movement during simulations.

### DETAILS
This document outlines fixes for issues in motion history recording and replay functionality within a simulation system. The fixes address incomplete data saving, incorrect path handling for file access, and insufficient drone movement verification before recording. Debug logging and error handling were added to improve troubleshooting capabilities.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`update_visualization_data()`**: Records motion history during simulation steps.
- **`_save_session_logs()`**: Saves motion history data to `motion_history.json` with debug info.
- **`create_replayable_session.py`**: Script that verifies simulation status, checks drone movement, and extends wait times for accurate replay.
- **`replay endpoint`**: Loads motion history from absolute paths with detailed error logging.

### DEPENDENCIES
- `simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py` (core simulation logic)
- `simulation/create_replayable_session.py` (session replay helper)
- Path handling libraries (e.g., `Path` from `pathlib`)

### USAGE
1. **For Debugging**: Check debug logs in `_save_session_logs()` and replay endpoint for motion history state.
2. **For Replays**: Ensure server restarts after path fixes are applied to load motion history correctly.
3. **For Drone Movement**: Run simulations for extended periods (e.g., 60 seconds) to accumulate meaningful motion history.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Motion history now includes debug info in `motion_history.json`, aiding troubleshooting empty or incomplete data.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Server restart is required after path fixes (`training_sessions_dir`) to ensure replay endpoints resolve absolute paths correctly.
