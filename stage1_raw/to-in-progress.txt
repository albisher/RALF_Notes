workflow-automation

### SUMMARY
Sets a task’s status to "in-progress" while automating pre-start checks and environment setup.

### DETAILS
This script orchestrates the transition of a task into active development mode by:
1. Validating prerequisites (dependencies, task completeness, test strategy).
2. Preventing concurrent "in-progress" conflicts via checks.
3. Executing a core command (`task-master set-status`) to update the status.
4. Triggering supplementary actions (e.g., branch creation, documentation access) to prepare the developer’s environment.

The workflow dynamically adapts to task complexity, suggesting blockers, timelines, or related references.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`task-master set-status`**: Core CLI command to update task status to "in-progress."
- **Pre-start validation checks**: Ensures dependencies, completeness, and test strategy are met.
- **Environment setup automation**: Branching, documentation, test watchers, and task display integration.

### DEPENDENCIES
`task-master` CLI tool (assumed to handle status updates), Git (for branching), and optional test frameworks (e.g., `pytest`).

### USAGE
```bash
./to-in-progress.sh <task_id>
```
Run after verifying all pre-checks pass. Outputs:
- Status confirmation.
- Estimated time (if available).
- Suggested next steps.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Pre-checks Critical
> If any validation fails, the script aborts and logs errors. Manual intervention is required before retrying.
>[!WARNING]- Concurrent Conflicts
> If another user sets the same task to "in-progress," the script may reject the request or enforce a queue. Check for conflicts via `task-master list-in-progress`.
