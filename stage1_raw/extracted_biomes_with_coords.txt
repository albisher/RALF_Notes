### SUMMARY
Extracts and organizes biome data with associated geographic coordinates for spatial analysis.

### DETAILS
This file contains a structured list of biome IDs (0 and 11) paired with multiple sets of geographic coordinates. Each entry appears to represent a cluster of points within a specific biome region, likely used for environmental mapping, terrain analysis, or ecological studies. The coordinates are formatted as nested lists of `[longitude, latitude]` pairs, suggesting a spatial relationship between sampled points. The data may represent sampled locations within a biome type, possibly for terrain classification, climate zone mapping, or biodiversity studies.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **BiomeID extraction**: Identifies and categorizes biome regions by numerical ID (e.g., 0, 11).
- **Coordinate clustering**: Groups latitude-longitude pairs into thematic sets, likely representing sampled locations within a biome.
- **Spatial analysis**: Enables visualization or further processing of geographic distributions for environmental research.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone text-based dataset; no external libraries required for basic analysis).

### USAGE
To use this data:
1. Parse the nested coordinate lists for each BiomeID to extract raw point data.
2. Visualize the coordinates in GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS) or plot them in Python/R using libraries like `geopandas` or `folium`.
3. Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) or spatial analysis techniques to derive biome-specific patterns.
4. Correlate coordinates with environmental variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) for ecological studies.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Data Context
> These coordinates likely represent sampled locations within a biome, possibly from a game (e.g., *Minecraft*), biome generator, or environmental simulation. Ensure consistency in coordinate systems (e.g., X/Y vs. longitude/latitude) when processing.
>[!WARNING]- Duplication Check
> Some coordinates appear repeated across entries (e.g., `[90.2875, 77.563]`). Validate data integrity by cross-referencing with source metadata to avoid redundant analysis.
