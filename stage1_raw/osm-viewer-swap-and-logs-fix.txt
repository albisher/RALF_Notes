### SUMMARY
Fixes OSM viewer swap misassignment and ensures view logs appear in the sidebar for proper visualization and debugging.

### DETAILS
This fix addresses two critical issues in an OSM (OpenStreetMap) viewer application:
1. **Incorrect View Swapping**: The 2D view was incorrectly assigned to the 3D isometric panel, causing visual misalignment. The root was in improper initialization logic where both containers were redirected to generic Cesium methods.
2. **Missing Logs in Sidebar**: View check logs were not displayed in the sidebar due to type filtering in the logging system, preventing debugging of quad-view operations.

The solution involved explicit container-based initialization and expanded logging to include all log types, ensuring logs appear in the UI.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`initializeOSMViewsForLayout`**: Reassigned viewer initialization based on container IDs (`cesium-2d-top-viewer`/`cesium-3d-viewer`).
- **`initCesium2DTopViewer`/`initCesiumViewer`**: Updated to handle correct container-specific initialization.
- **`_logToUI` (logging-box.js)**: Modified to include all log types in `communicationLog` array.
- **`logViewChecks` (app-data.js)**: Added `type: 'communication'` to ensure logs appear in the sidebar.

### DEPENDENCIES
- `simulation/frontend/app-data.js`
- `simulation/frontend/boxes/logging-box.js`
- Cesium.js libraries (implicitly used for 2D/3D viewer initialization)

### USAGE
To apply this fix:
1. Replace the generic `initCesiumViewer(containerId)` calls with container-specific logic in `app-data.js`.
2. Update `_logToUI` to log all entries (not just `'communication'` type) in `logging-box.js`.
3. Ensure `logViewChecks` includes `type: 'communication'` for quad-view logs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fix ensures **quad-view initialization** works correctly by explicitly routing containers to their respective Cesium viewers, preventing visual conflicts between 2D/3D modes.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Overwriting generic initialization methods may break other dependencies if not thoroughly tested. Always validate with live OSM data before deployment.
