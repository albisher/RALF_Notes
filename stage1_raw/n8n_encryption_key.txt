### SUMMARY
Stores and analyzes an encryption key used in n8n workflows for secure data handling.

### DETAILS
This appears to be a **base64-encoded hexadecimal string** representing an encryption key or secret identifier, likely used in **n8n’s authentication, node keys, or secure data storage**. The string is 64 characters long, matching the expected length of a base64-encoded key (e.g., 32 bytes of raw data encoded in base64 yields ~44 chars, but this is longer, suggesting it may be a longer key or a hashed version). The value could be:
- A **node key** for n8n workflows.
- A **hash** (e.g., SHA-256) of a password or secret.
- A **custom key** for encryption/decryption in workflows.

No context is provided, so its exact purpose is unclear without additional metadata (e.g., where it’s stored or used).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`n8n_encryption_key`**: Likely a placeholder for a key used in authentication or data encryption within n8n workflows.
  *(Note: This is not a function call but a raw key string.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone key string, no external dependencies implied).

### USAGE
To use this key in n8n:
1. **Store it securely** (e.g., in n8n’s settings or a secrets manager).
2. **Reference it in workflows** (e.g., via a node like "Set Variable" or "Execute HTTP Request" with a key parameter).
3. **Validate it** if it’s a hashed key (e.g., compare against a known hash).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Length and Format
> This key is **64 chars long**, which is unusual for a typical 32-byte (256-bit) key (base64 encodes 32 bytes as ~44 chars). It may be:
> - A **longer key** (e.g., 64 bytes → ~88 chars base64).
> - A **hash** (e.g., SHA-512 outputs 128 hex chars → ~96 base64 chars).
> - A **custom format** (e.g., UUID or GUID-like).
>
>[!WARNING]- Security Risk
> Without context, this key could be:
> - **Exposed in plaintext** (risk if stored in logs or configs).
> - **Misinterpreted** (e.g., used as a password instead of a key).
> Always validate its purpose in the broader system.
