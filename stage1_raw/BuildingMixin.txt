### SUMMARY
Manages building operations via a mixin pattern, handling spawning, saving, and fetching buildings from a backend API.

### DETAILS
`BuildingMixin` implements a **mixin pattern** to encapsulate building-related operations (refreshing, saving, and loading buildings) while delegating API calls to `APICommunicationBox`. It ensures **single responsibility** by focusing solely on building lifecycle management. The `refreshBuildings()` method fetches all saved buildings from the backend, logs success/error states, and updates `this.savedBuildings`. The `saveBuilding()` method sends a building ID to the backend via POST request, validating success/failure responses.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`refreshBuildings()`**: Asynchronously retrieves and caches all buildings from the backend API.
- **`saveBuilding(buildingId)`**: Saves a building’s ID to the backend database via API communication.

### DEPENDENCIES
`window.apiCommunicationBox`, `window.loggingBox` (external modules for API calls and logging).

### USAGE
1. Attach `BuildingMixin` to an object (e.g., `class MyApp extends BuildingMixin`).
2. Call `refreshBuildings()` to load buildings.
3. Call `saveBuilding(buildingId)` to persist changes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Error Handling
> Throws errors if `APICommunicationBox` is unavailable or API responses fail, with fallback logging to `console.error` if `loggingBox` is missing.
>[!WARNING]- Data Validation
> Assumes `result.data.success` exists; missing data may cause silent failures. Always validate `result.success` before processing.
