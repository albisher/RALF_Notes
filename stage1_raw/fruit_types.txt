### SUMMARY
Describes alien fruit types categorized by structural and functional traits for botanical or sci-fi reference.

### DETAILS
This file outlines a taxonomy of non-terrestrial fruit variants, grouping them into broad categories based on physical characteristics such as texture, gas content, and bioluminescence. The classification includes both organic and inorganic forms, reflecting speculative or extraterrestrial botanical diversity. Each category (e.g., "Berries," "Gas-filled Bladders") defines key traits like clustering, hardness, or light emission, useful for worldbuilding or scientific fiction.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Structural Taxonomy**: Defines alien fruit morphology for narrative or research purposes.
- **Functional Classification**: Assigns traits (e.g., "light-emitting") to inspire alien biology or ecosystems.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
Referenced in alien biology studies, sci-fi worldbuilding, or botanical fiction. Useful for describing alien flora, food sources, or ecological adaptations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Alien Adaptations**
> Many types (e.g., "Gas-filled Bladders") suggest pressure-resistant or buoyancy-based survival strategies, common in extreme environments.
>[!WARNING]- **Inconsistency Note**
> Some categories (e.g., "Mineralized Nodules") imply hybrid organic/inorganic traits—may require further refinement for cohesive taxonomy.
