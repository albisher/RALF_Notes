### SUMMARY
Enhanced WorldDetail page with faster Quick Actions, hash-based asset generation, active world toggling, expanded sidebar navigation, and character physical body linking.

### DETAILS
This file documents comprehensive enhancements to the **WorldDetail page**, addressing user requests for improved functionality. The solution includes **Quick Actions** that now execute actions directly (e.g., opening asset creation dialogs instead of URL changes), a **hash-based asset creation system** for deterministic generation and customization, an **active world toggle** for dynamic world selection, an **expanded sidebar** with new navigation groups, and **character physical body linking** using hashed names for consistent form associations. The implementation leverages Vue.js, API services, and Vuex stores for state management.

---

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`showAssetCreator`**: Opens a dialog for asset creation (character, element, location).
- **`generateFromHash`**: Creates an asset using a seed and hash, fetching saved custom values if available.
- **`toggleActiveWorld`**: Toggles the active state of a world (deactivates if active, activates otherwise).
- **`toggleGroup('assetCreation')`**: Expands/collapses the sidebar group for asset creation links.
- **`physicalFormTypes`**: Defines predefined character physical body options (e.g., Human, Robot, Dragon).
- **`generateHash`**: Computes a SHA-256 hash from a seed input for deterministic asset generation.

---

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (3.x), Vuetify (for UI components), Vuex (state management), API service (`apiService`), worlds store (`worldsStore`), UI store (`uiStore`), router (`router`), asset creation dialog logic.

---

### USAGE
1. **Quick Actions**: Click buttons (e.g., "Add Character") to open a dialog directly on the WorldDetail page.
2. **Hash-Based Creation**:
   - Input a seed in the asset creation dialog.
   - Generate a hash and preview fields.
   - Edit/modify generated values and save them.
3. **Active World Toggle**: Click the button to switch between worlds (deactivate if active).
4. **Sidebar Navigation**:
   - Expand groups (e.g., "Asset Creation") to access links.
   - Use links to create assets (e.g., characters, plants) directly from the sidebar.
5. **Character Physical Body**:
   - Select a form type during character creation.
   - The system links the character’s name to a consistent form via hashing.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Deterministic Hashing**
> Character physical body linking relies on hashing the character name. This ensures consistent form associations across sessions, but users can override defaults for customization.

>[!WARNING]- **State Management**
> The implementation uses Vuex stores (`worldsStore`, `uiStore`) for global state. Ensure proper cleanup during page transitions to avoid conflicts with other instances.
