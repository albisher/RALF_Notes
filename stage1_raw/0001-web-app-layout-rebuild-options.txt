### SUMMARY
Explores modern web app layout patterns and provides draft layout options for a Vue.js-based web application rebuild.

### DETAILS
This document outlines research on modern web app layout principles, including responsive design, minimalism, adaptive visualizations, and accessibility best practices. It compares the current layout structure (a three-pane design with left/right sidebars and a central content area) against proposed enhancements. The document also details Vue.js best practices for component-based architecture, SFCs, and separation of concerns.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Research Summary**: Compiles modern web app design principles (responsive, minimalistic, adaptive visualizations).
- **Current Architecture**: Visualizes existing layout components (header, tabs, left/right sidebars, content area).
- **Layout Options**: Proposes a "Classic Dashboard Layout" enhancement with improved spacing and organization.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (3.x), Vue Router, Vuex (for state management), Tailwind CSS (optional styling), Bootstrap (optional UI components).

### USAGE
This document serves as a reference for selecting or refining a web app layout. Developers can use the research summary to inform design decisions and apply the proposed layout structure to rebuild or enhance the current architecture.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The current layout’s left sidebar contains multiple overlapping controls (Build, Spawn, Cmd), which may cause visual clutter. Consider consolidating these into a single collapsible panel or implementing a modal system for complex actions.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The right sidebar’s "Logs" section lacks dynamic filtering or search functionality, which could hinder usability for large datasets. Implementing context-aware filters (e.g., time-based or severity-based) is critical for accessibility and efficiency.
