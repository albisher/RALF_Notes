### SUMMARY
Review of OOP principles violations in autonomous exploration system, focusing on SOLID principles and general OOP best practices.

### DETAILS
This document analyzes violations of the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** in an autonomous exploration system. It highlights problematic classes (`AutonomousExplorationDrone`, `GroundTruthLogger`, `BaseStation`) that handle multiple responsibilities, violating SRP by having multiple reasons to change. The review also notes a hard-coded visualization function (`create_3d_plot`) that is not extensible, violating OCP. The analysis includes specific responsibilities, reasons for violations, and severity ratings.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **create_3d_plot**: Creates a 3D plot with hard-coded visualization logic, violating OCP.
- **FrontierExplorerBox**: Handles frontier detection and selection, compliant with SRP.
- **ExplorationManagerBox**: Manages exploration lifecycle but uses `time.time()` (minor dependency issue).
- **AutonomousExplorationDrone**: Combines physics, LiDAR, telemetry, and mapping responsibilities (SRP violation).
- **GroundTruthLogger**: Handles data formatting, console output, file I/O, and broadcasting (SRP violation).
- **BaseStation**: Manages telemetry, storage, path tracking, output, and statistics (SRP violation).

### DEPENDENCIES
- `time` (used in `ExplorationManagerBox`),
- `plotly.graph_objects` (for `create_3d_plot`),
- External libraries for LiDAR, telemetry, and broadcasting (not explicitly listed).

### USAGE
This document serves as a **code review** to identify and correct OOP design flaws in an autonomous exploration system. It provides grades and justifications for compliance with SOLID principles, particularly SRP and OCP.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The `AutonomousExplorationDrone` and `BaseStation` classes have **critical SRP violations**, each requiring **multiple refactorings** to isolate responsibilities. For example, splitting `BaseStation` into `TelemetryProcessor`, `StorageManager`, and `OutputHandler` would improve modularity.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Hard-coded visualizations (e.g., `create_3d_plot`) make future extensions difficult. Consider using **dependency injection** or **abstract base classes** to allow dynamic configuration of plot styles and data sources.
