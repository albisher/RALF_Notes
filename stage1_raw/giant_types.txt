### SUMMARY
Lists D&D 5th Edition giant races and elemental/ancient variants with descriptive names.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates the distinct **Giant** races from *Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition*, including elemental, elementalized, and legendary variants. Each entry represents a unique subtype of giant, categorized by elemental affinity (fire, frost, storm, etc.) or thematic traits (ancient, colossal). The list serves as a reference for monster statistics, lore, and creature descriptions in fantasy campaigns.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Race Identification**: Classifies giants by subtype (e.g., *Fire Giant*, *Storm Giant*).
- **Lore Reference**: Provides thematic context for each giant variant (e.g., *Ancient Giant* implies long-lived, *Earth Shaker* implies destructive power).
- **Monster Stats**: Implicitly links to D&D’s monster manuals for CR, HP, and abilities (e.g., *Titan* has CR 20+).

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
Referenced in:
- **Monster Design**: Used to create or reference giant creatures in campaigns.
- **Roleplaying**: Describes traits (e.g., *Cloud Giant*’s aerial mobility) for NPCs or enemies.
- **Tabletop Games**: Cross-referenced with *D&D 5e Monster Manual* for stats and lore.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Elementalization Note
> Each elemental giant (e.g., *Fire Giant*, *Frost Giant*) retains core giant traits but gains elemental-specific abilities (e.g., fire damage, frost resistance). Check *MM* for exact stats.
>[!WARNING]- **Legendary Variants
> Creatures like *Titan* and *Colossus* are CR 20+ and require high-level play; avoid using them in early campaigns unless balanced with adjustments.
