### SUMMARY
Describes soil types found in tundra biomes, emphasizing organic and silicate composition.

### DETAILS
This document categorizes soil types in tundra ecosystems, highlighting their organic-rich and silicate-rich characteristics. Tundra soils are typically cold and nutrient-poor due to permafrost and low biological activity, but organic matter accumulation occurs in surface layers (e.g., peat) from decomposed plant litter. Silicate-rich soils reflect mineral weathering from periglacial processes, where permafrost limits deep soil formation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Organic-rich soils**: Accumulate decomposed organic material (e.g., peat) in surface layers, supporting sparse vegetation.
- **Silicate-rich soils**: Dominated by weathered minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar), common in periglacial zones with minimal organic input.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This classification is useful for studying tundra ecology, carbon storage, and climate feedbacks. Researchers may reference these soil types when analyzing nutrient cycling or vegetation adaptation in Arctic and subarctic regions.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Organic Accumulation
> In tundra, organic matter (e.g., moss, lichen) decomposes slowly due to low temperatures, forming thick peat layers over centuries.
>[!WARNING]- Permafrost Limitation
> Silicate-rich soils are often shallow due to permafrost, restricting root penetration and nutrient availability.
