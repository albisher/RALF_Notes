### SUMMARY
Document outlining a production-ready scout system for advanced drone reconnaissance, focusing on pre-computation and dynamic mapping for centimeter-accurate 3D surface mapping and hazard detection.

### DETAILS
This document provides an overview of the **Scout system**, a mission-critical drone platform designed to operate autonomously 10 minutes ahead of a climbing robot. The system leverages pre-computation and dynamic mapping to generate high-precision 3D surface maps and detect environmental hazards. It references verified open-source alternatives and best practices for 2024–2025, ensuring reliability and accuracy.

The document links to key components:
- **Platform Selection** (drone hardware/software)
- **Sensor Suite** (e.g., LiDAR, cameras)
- **Processing & Analysis** (real-time data processing)

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Mission Profile**: Advanced reconnaissance with 10-minute lead time for hazard detection and mapping.
- **Pre-Computation**: Offline data processing to optimize real-time performance.
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Live updates to adjust to environmental changes for centimeter-level accuracy.

### DEPENDENCIES
- LiDAR sensors (e.g., from [FoxTech Robotics](https://www.foxtechrobotics.com))
- High-performance drones (e.g., from [Rock Robotics](https://www.rockrobotic.com))
- Open-source robotics frameworks (ROS, PX4, or custom middleware)

### USAGE
1. **Deploy Scout**: Integrate with a climbing robot’s path planning system.
2. **Precompute**: Run offline mapping/analysis (e.g., using sensor data).
3. **Dynamic Adjust**: Use real-time updates to refine maps and detect hazards.
4. **Verify**: Cross-check with references (e.g., FoxTech/rockrobotic articles).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Production Verification**
> All components are verified against 2024–2025 open-source best practices, ensuring compliance with current standards.
>[!WARNING]- **Hazard Dependency**
> Dynamic mapping relies on real-time sensor data; latency may affect accuracy if environmental changes occur faster than processing speed.
