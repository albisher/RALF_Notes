### SUMMARY
Manages centralized state for GPS, weather, building, and drone brand configurations in a simulation environment.

### DETAILS
`MasterControlsState` is a class implementing a single responsibility principle to encapsulate all master control configurations. It provides a static `getDefaultState()` method returning a comprehensive object with nested configurations for GPS (mode, location), map sources, building selection, time restrictions, training mode, weather (source, wind/precipitation data), and drone brand capabilities (vendor, models, and supported features). The design follows OOP principles with clear separation of concerns, adhering to a 250-line limit.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`getDefaultState()`**: Returns a structured default configuration object for all master controls, including nested sub-objects for GPS, weather, training, and drone brands.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (purely a state definition class; no external dependencies listed).

### USAGE
To use this class, call `MasterControlsState.getDefaultState()` to retrieve the initial configuration. The returned object can be modified or extended for runtime use in a simulation or drone control system.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Default Configuration
> The `getDefaultState()` method provides a standardized starting point for all master control settings, ensuring consistency across applications.
>[!WARNING]- Immutable Defaults
> While the returned object is mutable, the class itself does not enforce state updates—external logic must manage changes to avoid unintended side effects.
