### SUMMARY
Script automates creation of a fictional sci-fi world ("Space Peral") with predefined characters, robots, and elements via API calls.

### DETAILS
This script interacts with a backend API to:
1. Authenticate and retrieve an existing world or create a new "Space Peral" colony world
2. Populate it with predefined elements (characters, robots, buildings) based on provided documentation
3. Uses a token-based authentication system and handles both existing and new world scenarios

The world is designed as a self-sustaining colony with a central library created by Mc. Liberian Taba, featuring robotic characters and exploration drones.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **login()**: Authenticates with the API using test credentials.
- **get_existing_world(token)**: Finds the most populated existing Space Peral world by name.
- **create_world(token)**: Creates a new world if none exists, with detailed colony specifications.
- **generate_element(token, world_id, element_type, name, description, additional_data)**: Creates individual elements (characters/robots) with configurable metadata.
- **create_space_peral_elements(token, world_id)**: Orchestrates the population of all predefined Space Peral elements.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, json, datetime

### USAGE
1. Run script to authenticate and determine world state
2. Call `create_space_peral_elements()` to populate the world with predefined characters/robots
3. Elements are created with standardized metadata including personality traits and roles

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Authentication Note
> Uses hardcoded test credentials ("test"/"passtest") for demonstration purposes only. In production, replace with secure credentials management.
>[!WARNING]- World Conflict Warning
> If multiple runs occur, the script may overwrite existing elements. Consider adding version control or conflict resolution logic for production use.
