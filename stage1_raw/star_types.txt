### SUMMARY
A categorized list of stellar classifications based on luminosity, temperature, and evolutionary stage.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates various types of stars, categorized by their spectral classification, luminosity class, and evolutionary stage. Stars are grouped into distinct phases such as main sequence, giants, supergiants, and remnants (e.g., white dwarfs, neutron stars). Each entry represents a unique phase in a star’s lifecycle, reflecting differences in mass, temperature, and energy output.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Main Sequence**: Stars in the stable phase of hydrogen fusion in their cores (e.g., Sun).
- **Red Giant**: Evolved stars expanding and cooling after hydrogen depletion in the core.
- **White Dwarf**: Remnant core of low-to-medium-mass stars post-nuclear exhaustion.
- **Neutron Star/Pulsar/Magnetar**: Dense, collapsed remnants of massive stars post-supernova.
- **Brown Dwarf**: Failed stars too faint to sustain nuclear fusion.
- **Protostar/T Tauri**: Pre-main-sequence stars forming from collapsing molecular clouds.
- **Hypergiant/White Hypergiant**: Extremely luminous, short-lived stars with unstable cores.
- **Luminous Blue Variable**: Unstable, massive stars undergoing mass loss and eruptions.
- **X-ray Binary/Gamma-ray Burster**: Systems involving compact objects (e.g., neutron stars) interacting with accreting matter.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This list serves as a reference for astronomers, educators, or enthusiasts studying stellar classification, evolution, or observational astronomy. Useful for identifying star types in spectra, surveys, or theoretical models of stellar formation/remnants.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Evolutionary Context**
> Many of these types (e.g., Red Giant, Supergiant) appear in the later stages of a star’s lifecycle, depending on its initial mass. For example, high-mass stars evolve into supergiants, while low-mass stars become white dwarfs.
>[!WARNING]- **Overlap and Ambiguity**
> Some classifications (e.g., "Blue Giant" vs. "Blue Supergiant") overlap in luminosity/temperature. Distinguishing them requires spectral analysis or additional context (e.g., mass, age).
