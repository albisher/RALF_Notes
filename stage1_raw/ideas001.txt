### SUMMARY
Explores dynamic world map concepts for visualizing robot activity, log entries, and environmental data in a futuristic space setting.

### DETAILS
This document outlines ideas for a **Space Pearl** world map system that integrates robot tracking, log entries, and environmental data. The map would use a customizable 2D/3D representation of the planet, with interactive controls (zoom/pan) and real-time updates of robot positions. Log entries would be linked to locations via clickable markers, with filtering and sentiment-based visual cues. Advanced features include biome overlays, resource mapping, and communication network visualization, with storytelling capabilities for immersive exploration.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Interactive Map Display**: Base visualization layer with zoom/pan controls and custom projections.
- **Real-Time Robot Tracking**: Dynamic marker updates, robot type categorization, and time-based playback.
- **Log Entry Integration**: Location-to-log association, filtering, and chronological/dynamic display.
- **Biome Visualization**: Overlay biome boundaries with biome-specific filtering and tooltips.
- **Resource Mapping**: Icon/color-coded resource locations with accessibility filters.
- **Communication Network**: Signal strength/bandwidth visualization between robots and Blue City.
- **Interactive Storytelling**: Guided tours with animations and user-driven narratives.

### DEPENDENCIES
Leaflet/OpenLayers (2D maps), Three.js/Babylon.js (3D maps), React/Angular/Vue.js (frontend framework), JSON/SQLite/PostgreSQL (data storage).

### USAGE
1. **Design Phase**: Choose map projection, biome/resource icons, and UI controls (e.g., filters, sliders).
2. **Data Integration**: Load robot positions/logs from JSON databases or simulated sources.
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Implement real-time API polling for robot movements and log entries.
4. **Visual Enhancements**: Apply biome/resource overlays and network visualizations via JavaScript libraries.
5. **Storytelling**: Embed interactive narratives with clickable events tied to map locations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Custom Projections
> Space Pearl’s unique geography (e.g., polar biomes, resource-rich regions) may require non-Euclidean projections like Mollweide or a custom warped map to avoid distortion.
>[!WARNING]- Performance
> Procedural 3D maps or dense real-time tracking may strain low-end devices; optimize with LOD (Level of Detail) techniques or WebGL caching.
>[!INFO]- Data Privacy
> Log entries containing robot IDs or sensitive info should be anonymized or encrypted before visualization to comply with ethical guidelines.
