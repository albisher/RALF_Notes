### SUMMARY
Log documenting the deployment of two mapping robots in the western highlands, detailing their construction, dependencies, and experimental nature of the mission.

### DETAILS
This log records the deployment of two specialized mapping robots, **CylGre-Exp01** and **SphWhi-Ana02**, at coordinates **31.8° N, 33.5° E** on Sol 270 (year 20486). The primary objective is topographical mapping of the western highlands, utilizing recycled components from the **X3** series, including an advanced sensor array. The robots were assisted in construction by other **X-series robots** (X5 for energy solutions via solar power and X7 for structural integrity). The mission is experimental, with unknown outcomes regarding data collection efficacy or unintended chaos, potentially influencing future deployments or altering existing plans.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **CylGre-Exp01**: Cylindrical mapping robot with advanced sensor array for topographical data collection.
- **SphWhi-Ana02**: Spherical mapping robot, also equipped with recycled X3 sensor components.
- **X5**: Provided solar-powered energy solutions for the new units.
- **X7**: Assisted in structural integrity and construction of the mapping robots.

### DEPENDENCIES
recycled components from **X3**, solar power expertise from **X-series robots (X5)**, structural expertise from **X-series robots (X7)**.

### USAGE
The robots are deployed for **topographical mapping** in the western highlands. Their construction relies on modular X-series components and external energy/support from other X-series robots. The mission is exploratory, requiring monitoring of data accuracy and operational stability.
