### SUMMARY
Evaluates procedural world type terrain generation success metrics across diverse environments.

### DETAILS
This document presents results from a **comprehensive world type terrain generation test**, assessing how well different procedural generation systems produce distinct terrain patterns for seven distinct environments: rocky planets, spiral galaxies, floating cloud worlds, orbital space stations, space ships, rocky asteroids, and lunar moons. Each test evaluates success via statistical metrics (mean, standard deviation, range) and uniqueness of generated values, confirming all world types produce statistically distinct terrain distributions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Terrain Generation Engine**: Produces unique procedural terrain for each world type.
- **Statistical Analysis Module**: Evaluates mean, standard deviation, and range of generated values.
- **Differentiation Check**: Ensures no overlap between world types in generated terrain patterns.

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed, but likely relies on:
- Procedural generation algorithms (e.g., noise-based terrain generation)
- Statistical libraries (e.g., NumPy for mean/std calculations)
- Hashing functions for uniqueness validation

### USAGE
This document serves as a validation report for procedural world generation systems. To replicate:
1. Run the generation engine for each world type.
2. Collect statistical metrics (mean, std, range).
3. Compare uniqueness of generated values across types.
4. Confirm all metrics meet distinctiveness criteria.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Insight
> All seven world types achieved distinct statistical distributions, confirming procedural systems can reliably differentiate between environments like planets, asteroids, and cloud worlds.
>[!WARNING]- Edge Case Note
> Space-related environments (space station/ship) show slightly lower uniqueness in range (0.100–0.900) compared to others, indicating potential variability in procedural noise parameters.
