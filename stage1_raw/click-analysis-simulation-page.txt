### SUMMARY
Analyzes interactive click-by-click functionality of a simulation UI for view mode, time controls, and log filters.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a test plan for an interactive simulation page (`/`) where users can manipulate view modes (Quad View, 3D Only, 2D Only, OSM), time controls, and log filters. The test focuses on visual and functional changes after clicking elements like view mode tabs, time controls, and log filters. Most tests indicate visual changes but lack full end-to-end verification due to unresolved issues (e.g., broken 2D panel, unconfirmed persistence). Console logs reveal partial functionality gaps.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Quad View Button**: Switches to a 4-panel view (3D, 2D, OSM, etc.).
- **3D Only Button**: Displays a single 3D view.
- **2D Only Button**: Displays a 2D-only view.
- **OSM View Button**: Switches to OpenStreetMap (OSM) view with additional test buttons appearing.
- **Reset View Button**: Resets the camera/view to default.
- **Filter by Sender Dropdown**: Opens a dropdown to filter logs by sender (e.g., HMRSSimulationLive, LoggingBox).
- **Log Filters (Type, Receiver)**: Dynamic filtering of log entries.
- **Log Actions (Clear, JSON, CSV)**: Export/clear log data formats.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Frontend UI framework (likely React/Three.js for 3D rendering).
- Backend simulation server (SocketIO, WebSocket-based).
- Logging system (console logs, JSON/CSV export).
- OSM integration (OpenStreetMap API).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5007/` to access the simulation page.
2. Test interactive elements by clicking buttons (e.g., view modes, filters).
3. Observe visual changes and verify persistence (e.g., camera reset, log filtering).
4. Cross-check with console logs for hidden issues (e.g., broken 2D panel).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Critical Limitation**: Visual changes do not guarantee functional correctness. For example, the 2D panel is broken per console logs, and the reset view may not persist changes correctly. Always verify end-to-end behavior beyond visual feedback.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Partial Functionality**: Some features (e.g., OSM view test buttons) appear to work visually but may not integrate fully with the simulation backend. Testers should validate backend responses (e.g., log filters, camera state) beyond UI changes.
