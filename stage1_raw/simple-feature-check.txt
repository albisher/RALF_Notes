### SUMMARY
Automated UI feature verification tool using Puppeteer to validate web application pages and capture screenshots.

### DETAILS
This script automates UI feature checks by launching a Puppeteer browser instance, navigating to predefined URLs, and capturing screenshots of each page. It evaluates page titles to determine if pages load successfully, logs results, and organizes screenshots in a timestamped directory. The tool handles errors gracefully by saving additional screenshots for failed tests.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **SimpleFeatureCheck**: Main class managing screenshot directory, URL testing, and Puppeteer browser lifecycle.
  - `init()`: Sets up the screenshot directory with a date-based naming convention.
  - `getScreenshotName(feature, description)`: Generates filenames by cleaning descriptions and appending timestamp/counter.
  - `takeScreenshot(page, feature, description)`: Captures a full-page screenshot and logs success/failure.
  - `testPage(page, url, feature, description)`: Navigates to a URL, takes a screenshot, and checks page title validity.
- **runAllTests()**: Orchestrates the entire test suite, launches Puppeteer, executes tests sequentially, and aggregates results.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Initialize the class: `const checker = new SimpleFeatureCheck();`
2. Run tests: `await checker.runAllTests();`
3. Configure `baseUrl` in constructor if needed (defaults to `localhost:8443`).
4. Extend the `tests` array in `runAllTests()` to include additional endpoints.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Screenshots are saved in `./feature-screenshots/<YYYYMMDD>/` with filenames like `YYYYMMDD-0001-feature-description.png`. Always check this directory for test results.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid running this in production environments without proper sandboxing. The script uses `--no-sandbox` for testing, which may expose security risks. Use `--headless: new` for modern browser rendering.
