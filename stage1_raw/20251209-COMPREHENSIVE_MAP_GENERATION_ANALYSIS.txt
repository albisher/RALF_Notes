### SUMMARY
Analyzes map generation processes across multiple world types using a box-based enhancement system, verifying visual quality and backend execution workflows.

### DETAILS
This report evaluates the **Comprehensive Map Generation System** by testing seven world types (Planet, Galaxy, Cloud World, Space Station, Moon, Asteroid, Space Ship) with predefined hash inputs. The methodology involves UI interaction (via `/map-generator`), automated screenshot capture after generation, and visual analysis of outputs. The enhancement system relies on procedural algorithms like **SimplexNoise**, **LloydsRelaxation**, and **HydraulicErosion**, with backend logs tracking box execution order. The goal is to ensure consistency in visual quality (e.g., biome diversity, 3D shading) and correctness of enhancements (e.g., river systems, modular structures).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **WorldTypeBoxSelector.get_boxes()**: Dynamically selects applicable enhancement modules per world type.
- **LloydsRelaxation**: Smooths Voronoi-generated terrain for uniform structures (e.g., space stations).
- **HydraulicErosion**: Simulates river/landform erosion (Planet/Moon).
- **MoistureCalculator**: Assigns biomes based on moisture levels (Planet only).
- **HabitabilityScoring**: Determines city/ship placement viability.
- **Hillshading/FractalEdge**: Adds depth/natural coastlines to visuals.
- **GalaxyPointCloud**: Renders nebula fog for galaxy maps.

### DEPENDENCIES
UI framework (e.g., React/Angular), procedural generation libraries (e.g., Perlin noise variants), backend logging tools, screenshot capture utilities.

### USAGE
1. Navigate to `/map-generator` in a browser.
2. Input a test hash (e.g., `test-planet-001`).
3. Click "Quick Preview" to trigger generation.
4. Wait 8–10 seconds, then capture a screenshot.
5. Analyze visual completeness, enhancement visibility, and color accuracy against expected results.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Screenshot Priority**
> Screenshots are critical for visual validation. Ensure filenames follow `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-worldtype-hash.png` convention to maintain traceability.
>[!WARNING]- **Backend Logs Dependency**
> Without backend logs, box execution order cannot be verified. Logs must be reviewed alongside screenshots for discrepancies.
