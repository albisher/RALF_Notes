### SUMMARY
Explains the process and command for permanently cancelling a task in a structured workflow system.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the procedure for cancelling a task permanently, detailing reasons, pre-checks, execution, and post-cancellation impacts. It emphasizes ensuring no critical dependencies remain, verifying rationale, and documenting lessons learned before applying the `task-master` command to set the task status to `cancelled`. The process includes dependency updates, cleanup actions, and historical preservation to maintain transparency and learning.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`task-master set-status`**: Executes the command to update a task’s status to `cancelled`.
- **Pre-Cancellation Checks**: Validates dependencies, partial implementations, and rationale before cancellation.
- **Cancellation Impact Analysis**: Manages dependency notifications, scope updates, and cleanup tasks post-cancellation.

### DEPENDENCIES
`task-master` CLI tool (command-line interface for task management).

### USAGE
1. **Identify Task**: Locate the task ID to cancel.
2. **Pre-Checks**: Confirm no critical dependencies, verify partial work, and document rationale.
3. **Execute**: Run `task-master set-status --id=<TASK_ID> --status=cancelled`.
4. **Post-Process**: Notify dependencies, archive work, update documentation, and preserve historical context.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Ensure all pre-cancellation checks are completed before executing the command to avoid unintended consequences.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid cancelling tasks with active dependencies or partial implementations without updating affected teams.
