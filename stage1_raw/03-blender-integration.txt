### SUMMARY
Explores Blender’s integration for robotics simulation via Python scripting and add-ons like DroneCam.

### DETAILS
This document details how Blender, an open-source 3D suite, can be used for robotics simulation by leveraging its Python API and add-ons. It highlights capabilities such as model creation, physics simulation, and real-time drone control via the **DroneCam** add-on. The API enables scripting for automation, while add-ons like DroneCam provide FPV flight simulation with gamepad input. The integration is useful for robotics visualization, training, and prototyping but lacks full physics accuracy compared to dedicated simulators.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add()`**: Creates a cube mesh in Blender.
- **`bpy.ops.rigidbody.world_add()`**: Initializes a rigidbody physics world.
- **`DroneCam` add-on**: Enables real-time drone FPV simulation with gamepad input.
- **`animate_drone()`**: Handles frame-based drone movement and propeller rotation.

### DEPENDENCIES
`bpy`, `mathutils`, `blender` (built-in), `DroneCam` add-on (external).

### USAGE
1. Install Blender and the **DroneCam** add-on.
2. Use the Python API to script robot/environment modeling and physics.
3. Activate DroneCam via Blender’s add-ons panel for FPV drone simulation.
4. Export models to other simulators (e.g., Gazebo) if needed.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The **DroneCam** add-on is experimental and may require manual setup (e.g., gamepad configuration). Test in a sandbox environment first.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Blender’s physics are simplified; avoid over-reliance on rigidbody dynamics for high-fidelity robotics. Supplement with other simulators for critical applications.
