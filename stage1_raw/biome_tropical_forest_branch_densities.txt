### SUMMARY
Records observed branch density metrics in tropical forest branches.

### DETAILS
This file appears to document qualitative assessments of branch density levels in tropical forest branches, likely for ecological or environmental research. The values "dense" and "very dense" categorize the density visually or empirically, potentially used for habitat analysis, biodiversity studies, or vegetation modeling.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Data Collection**: Records qualitative branch density observations.
- **Ecological Classification**: Categorizes forest branch density for research purposes.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This file is likely used as raw observational data for further analysis in ecological studies. It may be referenced in reports or databases where branch density classifications are needed.

### RELATED
[[none]]

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Note
> These values are qualitative assessments and may require quantitative validation (e.g., via measurements like branch diameter or canopy cover) for standardized ecological studies.
>[!WARNING]- Interpretation Caution
> Subjectivity in "dense" vs. "very dense" could vary between observers; standardization is recommended for reproducibility.
