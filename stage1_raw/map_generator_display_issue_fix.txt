### SUMMARY
Identifies and documents a fix for a map generator display issue where UI fails to render newly generated maps due to job cleanup and UI fetching problems.

### DETAILS
The issue involved generated maps not displaying in the UI, showing stale "Quraan" and "SPQ8" maps instead. Root causes included rapid job cleanup in an in-memory manager, potential UI condition failures for `result.data.map_data`, and timing issues where results were fetched after job cleanup. The fix involved enhanced result fetching logic with logging, immediate result retrieval on completion, and comprehensive debugging to track response structures and errors.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Job Cleanup Prevention**: Modified job retention logic to avoid premature loss of results.
- **Result Fetching Logic**: Added immediate result retrieval upon job completion status.
- **Debug Logging**: Introduced structured logging for result structures, errors, and UI rendering flow.

### DEPENDENCIES
- In-memory job manager (potentially custom or third-party)
- API endpoints for map generation and result fetching
- UI components (e.g., `MapPreview` component)
- Browser console logging tools

### USAGE
To reproduce and verify:
1. Trigger a map generation job.
2. Check browser console for debug logs.
3. Verify `MapPreview` component receives and renders `map_data` immediately after job completion.
4. Test with fresh jobs to isolate job cleanup timing issues.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Ensure the `MapPreview` component is correctly subscribed to `map_data` updates. If using React/Vue, verify lifecycle hooks or event listeners are properly implemented to avoid stale data.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Increasing job retention time may not fully resolve the issue if the UI fetches results after cleanup. Consider persistent storage (e.g., database) for critical jobs to guarantee data availability.
