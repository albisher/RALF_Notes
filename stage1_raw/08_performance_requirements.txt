### SUMMARY
Defines performance and scalability benchmarks for a digital application handling large datasets, user concurrency, and real-time interactions.

### DETAILS
This document outlines technical performance needs, including data volume, response times, resource constraints, and scalability considerations for an application managing complex narratives, visualizations, and AI interactions. It addresses expected workloads (e.g., concurrent users, content growth) and hardware/software limitations to ensure efficient operation across platforms.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Data Volume Analysis**: Estimates character/element counts and world/story sizes.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Defines support for multi-user access and real-time edits.
- **Resource Profiling**: Specifies platform compatibility, storage, and processing demands.
- **Scalability Planning**: Outlines strategies for large datasets and complex relationships.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (foundational requirements document)

### USAGE
This document serves as a reference for architects/engineers to align system design with user expectations and operational constraints. Answered questions help refine technical specifications.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Insight
> **Concurrency Impact**: High concurrency may require distributed systems (e.g., sharding) to avoid bottlenecks in real-time updates.
>[!WARNING]- Tradeoff Warning
> **Storage vs. Performance**: Large datasets may necessitate trade-offs between storage efficiency (e.g., compression) and retrieval speed.
