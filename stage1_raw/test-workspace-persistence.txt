### SUMMARY
Tests if a workspace application retains state after page refresh using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing for workspace persistence by verifying if UI elements (world selector, time period dropdown, and writing content) retain functionality and state after a page refresh. It launches a headless browser, navigates to a workspace page, performs initial checks, interacts with UI components (e.g., selecting a world, choosing a time period, typing into a textarea), and then refreshes the page to confirm persistence of the selected state. Screenshots are captured at key stages for visual validation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testWorkspacePersistence**: Orchestrates the entire persistence test workflow, including browser launch, UI interactions, and refresh validation.
- **puppeteer.launch**: Configures and starts a headless Chrome browser with security and performance optimizations.
- **page.goto**: Navigates to the workspace URL with timeout and DOM content loading checks.
- **page.evaluate**: Extracts dynamic content (e.g., body text) for validation checks.
- **page.select**: Manages dropdown selections (e.g., world or time period).
- **page.type**: Simulates typing in a textarea for content persistence testing.
- **page.reload**: Simulates a page refresh to test state retention.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node test-workspace-persistence.js`.
3. Ensure the target workspace is accessible at `http://localhost:5173/workspace`.
4. Verify screenshots are saved in `checks/screenshots/` for debugging.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the workspace UI has a `<select>` element for world selection, a `<button>` for time period selection, and a `<textarea>` for writing content. Adjust selectors if the target application differs.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running in headless mode with `--disable-web-security` may expose the browser to security risks. Use only in controlled environments for testing.
