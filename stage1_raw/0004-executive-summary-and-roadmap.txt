### SUMMARY
High-level overview of a drone swarm simulation platform for window cleaning, detailing its production-ready status, components, and immediate deployment requirements.

### DETAILS
This document provides an executive summary and implementation roadmap for the **HMRS Window Cleaning Drone Swarm Simulation**, a fully functional enterprise-grade system designed for multi-drone operations. It highlights key features like specialized drone types (Scout, Overseer, Tanker-Mule, Tanker-Lifeline), real-time swarm coordination, and vendor-agnostic architecture supporting DJI and Parrot drones. The system includes advanced capabilities such as LiDAR-based building mapping, multi-modal window detection, and autonomous resupply. The document also outlines a modular architecture with 43 components and a professional web interface built with Vue.js and Plotly.

The primary roadblock is the non-operational Docker Desktop environment, requiring users to start Docker Desktop and run a Docker Compose command to deploy the simulation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Multi-Drone Swarm Coordination**: Real-time management via Master Coordinator.
- **Vendor Adapter Integration**: Supports DJI and Parrot drones with simulation mode.
- **Window Cleaning Automation**: LiDAR-based mapping, dirty window detection, and quality assurance.
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized setup via `docker compose` for quick local operation.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Docker Desktop (must be manually started)
- Docker Compose (v2+)
- PyBullet (for physics simulation)
- Socket.IO (for real-time communication)
- Vue.js 3 (for web interface)
- Plotly (for visualization)

### USAGE
1. **Start Docker Desktop** (application must be manually launched).
2. Navigate to the simulation directory and run:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```
3. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5007`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Dependency
> Docker Desktop must be running before any simulation commands can execute. Users must manually start Docker Desktop before proceeding.
>[!WARNING]- Configuration Clarity
> The `docker-compose.yml` file is located in a subdirectory (`docker/`), which may cause confusion for users expecting it in the root directory. Users should explicitly use the full path or the `-f` flag to locate the file correctly.
