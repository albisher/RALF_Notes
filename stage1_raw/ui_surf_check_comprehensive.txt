### SUMMARY
Documentation of a UI surf check using Puppeteer, highlighting existing screenshot collections and naming conventions for UI validation.

### DETAILS
This report documents a comprehensive UI validation effort using Puppeteer, focusing on existing screenshot archives in the `ui-checks/` folder. While Puppeteer automation encountered socket hang-up errors during browser initialization, the existing screenshots (60 files) provide thorough coverage of 15+ features, including landing pages, world creation, form elements, and dashboard states. The report details the successful implementation of a structured naming convention (YYYYMMDD-####-feature-description.png) and organizational structure for screenshots, along with error handling for SSL and system-specific issues.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`getScreenshotName(feature, description)`**: Generates standardized filenames for screenshots using date, counter, and feature details.
- **`testPage(page, url, feature, description)`**: Executes automated UI tests with error handling, capturing screenshots for both success and failure states.
- **`docker-compose` management**: Handles container lifecycle for Puppeteer and application services.
- **Feature test configuration**: Defines a list of URLs/features to validate via automated screenshots.

### DEPENDENCIES
Puppeteer, Docker, Node.js runtime, Chrome browser, and a web application running on a specified base URL.

### USAGE
1. **Setup**: Ensure Docker containers are running (`docker-compose up -d`).
2. **Validation**: Use the `testPage` function to automate UI checks across defined features.
3. **Screenshots**: Existing screenshots follow `./screenshots/ui-checks/` convention; new screenshots are generated with standardized naming.
4. **Error Handling**: Capture error states for debugging (e.g., SSL warnings, socket hangs).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The existing screenshot collection (`ui-checks/`) is the primary validation source due to Puppeteer’s socket hang-up errors. Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured for future automation runs.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> macOS-specific Puppeteer configurations may cause inconsistencies. Test on multiple environments before deployment.
