### SUMMARY
Describes a taxonomy of planetary size and type classifications used in astronomy and exoplanet studies.

### DETAILS
This file outlines a standardized naming convention for categorizing planetary sizes and types, ranging from sub-stellar objects like **Brown Dwarfs** to gas giants like **Super-Jupiters**. The taxonomy includes categories for terrestrial planets, ice giants, and substellar objects, reflecting their mass, composition, and orbital characteristics. It serves as a reference for comparing exoplanet sizes to known solar system bodies.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Size Classification**: Assigns descriptive labels (e.g., *Earth-Size*, *Neptune-Size*) to planetary masses.
- **Composition Mapping**: Links terms like *Dwarf*, *Compact*, and *Fragment* to inferred physical properties (e.g., rocky vs. gaseous).
- **Comparative Analysis**: Enables direct comparisons between hypothetical exoplanets and solar system analogs.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This taxonomy is used in:
- **Exoplanet research** to categorize discovered worlds.
- **Astrophysical modeling** for planet formation simulations.
- **Public outreach** (e.g., naming exoplanets) to convey scale intuitively.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Note
> Terms like *Super-Earth* and *Mini-Neptune* are **empirically debated**—some classify them as hybrid ice-rock gas worlds, while others treat them as distinct classes.
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity Warning
> *Colossal* and *Super-Giant* may overlap with stellar remnants (e.g., failed stars), requiring context-dependent classification.
