### SUMMARY
Automates taking a full-page screenshot of a dashboard with representative data using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a headless Chrome browser, navigate to a local dashboard endpoint (`http://localhost:3001/dashboard`), and capture a full-page screenshot (`dashboard-representative-numbers.png`). It includes error handling and ensures the browser is closed after execution. The script logs progress and errors to the console.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **takeDashboardRepresentative()**: Orchestrates the entire process: browser launch, navigation, screenshot capture, and cleanup.
- **puppeteer.launch()**: Initializes a headless Chrome instance with security flags (`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-setuid-sandbox`).
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to the dashboard URL with a network idle wait.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures the full-page screenshot at the specified path.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, node.js

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node take-dashboard-representative.js`.
3. Ensure the dashboard is accessible at `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the dashboard is running locally on port `3001`. Adjust the URL if needed.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer in headless mode with `--no-sandbox` may bypass security checks. Use cautiously in production environments.
