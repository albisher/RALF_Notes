### SUMMARY
A fully implemented machine learning-based drone learning system with randomized scenarios, weather challenges, and real-time visualization.

### DETAILS
This system trains drones using reinforcement learning to navigate complex tasks, including random positions, motor calibrations, and orientation recovery. It employs a neural network for control, integrated with PyBullet for realistic physics, and captures scenario outcomes via screenshots organized by scenario type and timestamp. The system supports live drone spawning, real-time learning, and performance statistics, including weather effects and mission task sequences. Weather conditions (e.g., wind, turbulence) dynamically alter flight dynamics, while task-specific operations (e.g., cleaning, debris removal) are tracked for progress and validation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Random Scenario Generation**: Creates varied learning environments (e.g., random positions, motor states, orientations).
- **Neural Network Controller**: Implements ML-based drone control with learned weights for adaptive behavior.
- **Screenshot System**: Automatically captures drone performance visualizations with success/failure metrics.
- **Weather Simulation**: Applies 6 weather conditions (calm, wind, turbulence, storm) to simulate real-world challenges.
- **Mission Task Automation**: Executes predefined tasks (e.g., air/water jets, cleaning) with progress tracking.
- **Live Learning Container**: Runs continuous training in a containerized environment (Port 5005) with real-time drone spawning.
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Tracks success rates, scenario history, and performance trends across all scenarios.

### DEPENDENCIES
PyBullet (physics simulation), TensorFlow/PyTorch (neural network training), Flask/Django (live visualization), containerized Docker (learning container), OpenCV (image processing for screenshots).

### USAGE
1. **Run Simulation**: Launch the system at Port 5005 to spawn drones and observe live learning.
2. **Train Drones**: Execute randomized scenarios (e.g., `random_position`, `base_to_building`) to improve neural network performance.
3. **Analyze Results**: Review screenshots in `simulation_output/learning_scenarios/` and daily summaries in `summaries/`.
4. **Adjust Weather/Tasks**: Modify weather conditions or mission tasks via configuration files to test robustness.
5. **Monitor Performance**: Use statistics to evaluate success rates and refine learning algorithms.
