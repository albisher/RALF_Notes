### SUMMARY
Automated interactive UI testing framework for identifying real user interface issues.

### DETAILS
This script implements an interactive UI testing tool that leverages Selenium to automate browser interactions and verify UI functionality. It logs issues found during testing, captures screenshots for debugging, and integrates API checks to validate backend responses. The `UITester` class initializes a Chrome headless browser, performs page load verification, and logs discrepancies between expected and actual UI behavior.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__(self, url="http://localhost:5007")`**: Initializes the tester with a target URL and prepares logging structures.
- **`log_issue(self, issue)`**: Records UI/API problems encountered during testing.
- **`setup_browser(self)`**: Configures Chrome options for headless execution with security and performance tweaks.
- **`take_screenshot(self, name)`**: Saves browser snapshots to a timestamped directory for debugging.
- **`check_api_response(self, endpoint, expected_keys)`**: Validates API endpoints for correct status codes and key presence.
- **`test_page_load(self)`**: Verifies basic page rendering (currently includes a placeholder sleep for Vue.js initialization).

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, time, json, selenium, selenium-webdriver, pytest (implicitly for execution), datetime

### USAGE
1. Instantiate `UITester` with the target URL.
2. Call `setup_browser()` to initialize the browser.
3. Execute tests (e.g., `test_page_load()`) and monitor logs for issues.
4. Use `take_screenshot()` to capture problematic states.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses Selenium’s headless Chrome with strict security flags (`--no-sandbox`, `--disable-dev-shm-usage`). Ensure the target URL is accessible and the backend API is operational.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The `time.sleep(3)` in `test_page_load()` is a placeholder—replace it with explicit UI waits (e.g., `WebDriverWait`) for dynamic content. Overly long waits may cause flaky tests.
