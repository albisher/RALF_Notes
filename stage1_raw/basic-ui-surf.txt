### SUMMARY
Automated UI validation tool using Puppeteer to test and capture screenshots of web pages.

### DETAILS
This script automates UI checks by launching a browser instance via Puppeteer, navigating to predefined URLs, and capturing screenshots of each page. It logs test results (pass/fail) and saves screenshots to a directory for debugging. The tool validates page titles and captures visual data when errors occur. The `runAllTests()` method executes a predefined list of routes, recording success/failure metrics.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **BasicUISurf constructor**: Initializes base URL, screenshot counter, and directory.
- **init()**: Creates a directory for screenshots if it doesn’t exist.
- **getScreenshotName(feature, description)**: Generates filenames with timestamp, counter, and sanitized feature/description.
- **takeScreenshot(page, feature, description)**: Captures a full-page screenshot and logs success/failure.
- **testPage(page, url, feature, description)**: Navigates to a URL, takes a screenshot, and checks if the page title exists.
- **runAllTests()**: Orchestrates browser launch, test execution, and cleanup across a predefined list of routes.
- **main()**: Entry point to instantiate and run the tester.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Configure `baseUrl` to point to your target API/server (default: `localhost:8443`).
3. Run the script: `node basic-ui-surf.js`.
4. Review screenshots in `./screenshots/ui-checks` and console logs for test results.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `headless: 'new'` to avoid Puppeteer’s default headless mode, which may not capture UI elements correctly. Ensure your server is running on the specified `baseUrl` before execution.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> If the server crashes during testing, screenshots may not be saved. Always check the `screenshotDir` manually for incomplete captures.
