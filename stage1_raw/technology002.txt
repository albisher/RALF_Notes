### SUMMARY
Explores advanced robotic sensor technologies for autonomous space terrain mapping and navigation.

### DETAILS
This document describes how robotic systems in space missions use a combination of stereo cameras, LIDAR (Laser Time-of-Flight sensors), IMUs, visual localization, and terrain-relative navigation to create detailed 3D terrain maps. These technologies enable real-time mapping, hazard detection, and autonomous navigation with minimal human intervention. The integration of sensor data with sophisticated algorithms like Stereo Depth Fusion (SDF) and Wildcat SLAM is critical for achieving high-precision 3D reconstructions and reliable localization.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Stereo Cameras**: Capture 3D imagery for terrain mapping.
- **LIDAR Sensors**: Provide high-resolution 3D terrain data via time-of-flight measurements.
- **IMUs**: Track robot motion and orientation for accurate localization.
- **Visual Localization with Coded Targets**: Enables navigation by matching onboard imagery with pre-existing maps.
- **Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN)**: Improves landing accuracy by correlating real-time terrain features with known landmarks.
- **Advanced Algorithms (SDF, SLAM)**: Integrate sensor data for autonomous mapping and navigation.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (theoretical framework; no external libraries listed).

### USAGE
This framework is applied in robotic platforms for space missions, such as planetary exploration rovers, to map complex terrains autonomously. Key applications include:
- Generating high-fidelity 3D terrain models.
- Enabling safe autonomous navigation and hazard avoidance.
- Supporting real-time decision-making during missions.
