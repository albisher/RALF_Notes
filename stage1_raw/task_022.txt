### SUMMARY
Configures Nginx with SSL/TLS using Certbot for secure HTTPS deployment via Docker Compose.

### DETAILS
This task involves setting up an SSL/TLS termination layer for an Nginx reverse proxy by integrating Certbot into a Docker Compose environment. The process includes adding a Certbot container to generate and renew certificates automatically, configuring Nginx to enforce HTTPS, and redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS. The solution ensures secure domain access and automated certificate management.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Certbot Container**: Manages SSL certificate generation and renewal via Docker Compose.
- **Nginx SSL Configuration**: Listens on port 443 with TLS certificates and enforces HTTPS redirection.
- **HTTP-to-HTTPS Redirect**: Forces all HTTP traffic to HTTPS via Nginx server blocks.

### DEPENDENCIES
certbot, docker, docker-compose, nginx

### USAGE
1. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to include a Certbot service with volumes for certificate storage.
2. Configure Nginx to use Certbot’s webroot or standalone mode for certificate validation.
3. Deploy the stack (`docker-compose up`) and verify HTTPS access and automatic renewal.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Certbot must be run with `--webroot` mode if using Nginx’s webroot plugin, or `--standalone` if no web server is running. Ensure the Certbot container’s volume mounts `/etc/letsencrypt` to persist certificates.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid hardcoding certificates in Nginx config; use Certbot’s dynamic reload or restart mechanism to apply changes without downtime. Test renewal before production deployment to confirm automatic updates.
