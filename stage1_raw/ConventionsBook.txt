### TYPE
documentation

### SUMMARY
Establishes standardized conventions for robotic design, atmospheric management, documentation, naming, and mission protocols in a robotic team system.

### DETAILS
This document outlines operational and design guidelines for robotic units, emphasizing environmental adaptability, atmospheric safety, and systematic documentation. It mandates detailed logs for each robot, including task performance, location data, anomalies, and resource tracking. Naming conventions standardize robot identification, while mission requirements mandate teams of at least two robots. Task descriptions must be precise to ensure effective coordination and iterative improvement.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Environmental Stress Accountability**: Ensures robots are designed to handle operational conditions.
- **Atmospheric Monitoring**: Requires long-term tracking of atmospheric stability and radiation effects.
- **Documentation Logging**: Mandates structured logs with timestamps, coordinates, task details, and maintenance records.
- **Naming Standardization**: Implements `[Body Shape][Color]-[Role][Unit]` format for internal management.
- **Mission Teaming**: Enforces teams of at least two robots per mission.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone procedural documentation)

### USAGE
Adhere to conventions for robot design, documentation, and mission execution. Use standardized naming and logging formats to ensure consistency across robotic teams.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Initial Landing Coordinates**
> Location logs for robots from 20454 (landing year) must default to the initial deployment site, regardless of actual movement.
>[!WARNING]- **Name Truncation**
> Exceeding 6 characters in robot names truncates the name to the first 6 digits, risking misidentification if not enforced.
