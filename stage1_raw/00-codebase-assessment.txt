### SUMMARY
Comprehensive evaluation of codebase adherence to research specifications, box architecture, and object-oriented principles, identifying areas needing improvement in hardcoding and legacy code.

### DETAILS
This assessment evaluates the alignment of a drone codebase with research requirements, box architecture usage, and object-oriented design. It highlights strong compliance in drone type implementations (all four HMRS drone types are fully implemented), box architecture adherence (90% compliant), and OOP implementation (95% compliant). However, it notes 70% of hardcoding/workarounds requires cleanup, particularly in configuration values and legacy non-boxed code remnants.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`hmrs_scout_drone.py`**: Implements Scout drone with LiDAR, camera, and path planning boxes.
- **`hmrs_tanker_mule_drone.py`**: Implements Tanker-Mule drone with autonomous docking and visual servoing.
- **`hmrs_overseer_drone.py`**: Overseer drone implementation with configurable sensor parameters.
- **`AdvancedLiDARBox`**: LiDAR sensor module for Scout drone, configurable for research specs.
- **`BatteryModel`**: Battery integration (fixed from prior issues).
- **`Box` architecture**: Core framework for modular drone components.

### DEPENDENCIES
`hmrs_scout_drone.py`, `hmrs_tanker_mule_drone.py`, `hmrs_tanker_lifeline_drone.py`, `hmrs_overseer_drone.py`, `AdvancedLiDARBox`, `CameraProcessorBox`, `PathPlannerBox`, `DockingSystemBox`, `BaseDrone` (inherited), `BatteryModel`, legacy non-boxed code snippets.

### USAGE
The assessment evaluates existing drone implementations against research specs. To improve:
1. Move configuration values to config files.
2. Remove legacy non-boxed code.
3. Verify sensor specifications (e.g., LiDAR range/accuracy).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Sensor implementations (e.g., `AdvancedLiDARBox`) allow research specs to be dynamically configured, ensuring flexibility for future adjustments.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Legacy non-boxed code persists in some areas; ensure full migration to box architecture to maintain consistency with OOP principles.
