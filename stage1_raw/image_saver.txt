### SUMMARY
A utility for saving PIL/Pillow images to disk with basic error handling.

### DETAILS
The code defines a function `save_image` that uses the Python Imaging Library (Pillow) to save an image object (`img`) to a specified file path (`file_path`). It attempts to save the image within a try-except block to catch and log any unexpected errors, printing a success message or error details. The same function is defined twice redundantly in the file, which is likely a copy-paste error.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **save_image(img, file_path)**: Saves an image object to a file path using Pillow’s `save()` method, with basic error handling.

### DEPENDENCIES
Pillow (`PIL`), Python Imaging Library (Pillow).

### USAGE
```python
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("input.jpg")  # Load an image
save_image(img, "output.jpg")  # Save to a new path
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!WARNING]- Redundancy Error
> The function `save_image` is defined twice in the file, which will cause a `NameError` at runtime. Ensure only one definition exists.
>[!INFO]- Basic Error Handling
> The function logs errors but does not re-raise them, which may mask underlying issues. Consider raising exceptions explicitly for critical failures.
