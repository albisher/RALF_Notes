### SUMMARY
Verifies installation and integration status of libraries for drone swarm simulation across three phases, with fallback mechanisms for compatibility.

### DETAILS
This document tracks the installation status of libraries required for a drone swarm system across three phases. Phase 1 includes swarm behavior, collision avoidance, and mission planning libraries, with some facing import mismatches. Phase 2 focuses on deep learning frameworks (PyTorch) and ROS 2 dependencies, which require system-level installation. Phase 3 confirms frontend availability. Boxes (modules) load successfully with fallback implementations for missing dependencies. The simulation status outlines prerequisites for running a swarm, including command processing, physics updates, and drone coordination.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`run_simulation_thread`**: Core simulation loop handling pre/post-processing, physics steps, and status updates.
- **Master Coordinator**: Orchestrates task distribution across drones.
- **Mission Executor**: Executes tasks with vision-based observations.
- **Task Queue**: Manages API commands for swarm operations.

### DEPENDENCIES
`pyswarming`, `torch`, `rclpy`, `orbslam3-python`, `droneops`, `DSSE`, `nerfacc`, ROS 2 system packages, JavaScript (frontend).

### USAGE
1. Verify library installations and import names.
2. Start simulation via `/api/start`.
3. Spawn drones and send commands via task queue.
4. Monitor swarm behavior in the simulation loop.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Libraries with import mismatches (e.g., `uav-collision-avoidance`) use fallback implementations to ensure graceful operation.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> `rclpy` requires ROS 2 system installation; failure to install system packages will trigger fallback mode, potentially limiting functionality.
