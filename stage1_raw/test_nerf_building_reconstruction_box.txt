### SUMMARY
Unit tests for NeRF-based building reconstruction module.

### DETAILS
This file contains unit tests for `NeRFBuildingReconstructionBox`, a component designed to reconstruct 3D building structures using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). The tests verify initialization, viewpoint addition, training with insufficient/sufficient viewpoints, and reconstruction quality. The `setUp` method initializes a test instance with reduced grid resolution and sample count for efficiency. The tests use synthetic RGB and depth data to simulate camera inputs.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **NeRFBuildingReconstructionBox**: Core class handling NeRF-based building reconstruction with configurable grid resolution, sampling, and learning parameters.
- **add_viewpoint**: Adds synthetic camera data (position, orientation, RGB, depth) to the reconstruction pipeline.
- **train_nerf**: Trains NeRF model; returns success status and reconstruction quality metrics.
- **reconstruct_building**: Generates a 3D model and compressed representation of the building from collected viewpoints.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, swarm.boxes.nerf_building_reconstruction_box

### USAGE
1. Import `NeRFBuildingReconstructionBox` from `swarm.boxes`.
2. Instantiate with test parameters (e.g., `grid_resolution=64`).
3. Add viewpoints via `add_viewpoint()` with synthetic data.
4. Train with `train_nerf()` and validate results.
5. Reconstruct the building with `reconstruct_building()`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Test Data Generation
> Synthetic RGB/depth data is generated randomly for testing, ensuring reproducibility but mimicking real-world noise patterns.
>[!WARNING]- Insufficient Viewpoints
> Training with fewer than required viewpoints (`test_train_nerf_insufficient_viewpoints`) will always fail, as NeRF reconstruction requires dense coverage for accurate results.
