### SUMMARY
Document summarizing completed HMRS assessment tasks including bug fixes, test suite reorganization, and creation of production scenarios for drone command and control systems.

### DETAILS
This file documents the completion of critical assessments for the HMRS (Hazard Mitigation and Response System) drone management platform. The assessment focused on resolving major issues in drone persistence, API compatibility, and test infrastructure while organizing tests into a production-focused framework. Key improvements included fixing drone disappearance bugs, refining logging systems, and creating realistic test scenarios for real-world drone operations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`/api/start`**: Modified to preserve existing drones during session initialization.
- **`run_simulation_thread()`**: Updated to maintain drone state across simulation lifecycle.
- **`master_coordinator.py` (line 390)**: Removed invalid `source=` parameter from LoggingBox calls.
- **`/assessment/tests/PRODUCTION_SCENARIOS.md`**: Created 12 scenarios covering real drone operations, mission planning, emergencies, and integration testing.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Python libraries: `datetime`, `logging` (for logging fixes)
- Drone SDKs: DJI, PX4, ArduPilot (for integration testing)
- Test frameworks: Custom assessment suite (moved from `/simulation/tests/`)

### USAGE
This document serves as a retrospective for the HMRS assessment team. To verify fixes:
1. Run `/api/start` with pre-existing drones to confirm persistence.
2. Execute `run_simulation_thread()` to validate drone lifecycle continuity.
3. Execute production scenarios (e.g., Scenario 06) to test full system integration.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Fixes
> The drone disappearance bug was resolved by ensuring session initialization respects pre-existing drones, preventing command failures during simulation. This directly addresses the core issue of lost drone state.
>[!WARNING]- Scope Expansion
> Moving tests to `/assessment/tests/` was intentional to reflect HMRS’s production-grade requirements, but requires careful migration of test dependencies and environment configurations to avoid breaking changes.
