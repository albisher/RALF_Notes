### SUMMARY
A simple enumeration of trunk thickness categories for structural or design reference.

### DETAILS
This file appears to define a discrete set of qualitative thickness descriptors—likely for use in a system categorizing wood, materials, or structural components. The values (`thin`, `medium`, `thick`, `massive`) represent ordinal levels of thickness, possibly for decision-making (e.g., engineering, construction, or inventory systems).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Thickness Classification**: Assigns a categorical label to physical thickness measurements.
- **Contextual Reference**: Used in workflows requiring qualitative comparisons (e.g., material selection, risk assessment).

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This could be embedded in a script or database as a lookup table for:
- **APIs**: JSON/key-value pairs (e.g., `{"thickness": "thin"}`).
- **Configuration**: Switches or flags in code (e.g., `if trunk_thickness == "thick"`).
- **Human Input**: Dropdown menus or prompts in user interfaces.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Ordinal Interpretation
> While values are qualitative, their order (`thin < medium < thick < massive`) may imply a gradient for algorithms requiring ranking (e.g., priority queues or risk scoring).
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity Risk
> Ambiguous thresholds exist between categories (e.g., "medium" vs. "thick"). Ensure alignment with domain-specific definitions to avoid misclassification.
