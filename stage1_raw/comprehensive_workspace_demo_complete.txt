### SUMMARY
A comprehensive demo report evaluating the functionality of a writer workspace application with AI-assisted features, tested for success in core features and UI/UX.

### DETAILS
This file documents a successful demonstration of a **writer workspace application** (likely named *ملاحم*) that integrates AI tools for creative writing. The demo validates 11 out of 17 planned features, achieving a 65% success rate, with all core functionalities working as expected. The application includes a three-panel layout (context/assets, writing editor, AI tools), supports Arabic/English, and features real-time writing, AI-generated prompts, and text analysis. The demo captures user workflows from application loading to AI-assisted content creation, emphasizing responsive design and intuitive navigation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Application Loading**: Vue.js frontend renders correctly at `http://localhost:5173/`.
- **Workspace Navigation**: Sidebar and route `/workspace` function properly with a three-panel layout.
- **Writing Editor**: Supports 500+ word narratives (e.g., cyberpunk story about *Cyber-Samurai Kaito*).
- **AI Tools**:
  - **Image Prompt Generation**: Creates text-to-image AI prompts.
  - **Story Ideas Generation**: Provides plot suggestions for cyberpunk settings.
  - **Text Analysis**: Offers writing feedback (tone, style, content).
- **UI/UX Components**: Context cards, asset library, and interactive buttons (17 total).
- **Arabic Support**: Displays titles (e.g., "مساحة الكتابة") and UI elements in Arabic.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue 3, Vuetify, Pinia (state management), Vuetify Router, Arabic language support libraries.

### USAGE
1. **Access the app** via `http://localhost:5173/` and load the *ملاحم* application.
2. Navigate to the **Writer Workspace** (`/workspace`) and use the three-panel layout.
3. Set context (world, time, location) and create assets (characters, data).
4. Write stories using the editor, then use AI tools for prompts, ideas, or analysis.
5. Organize content and assets via interactive UI elements.
