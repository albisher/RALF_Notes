### SUMMARY
A deterministic sci-fi world generator system creates interconnected assets, timelines, and narratives using hash-based reproducibility for scalable sci-fi universe development.

### DETAILS
This system generates a fully realized sci-fi world with deterministic asset generation via hash-based algorithms, ensuring identical outputs for the same inputs. It integrates frontend/backend components to produce a cohesive narrative ecosystem including characters, locations, and temporal events. The implementation emphasizes spatial and temporal linking through 3D coordinates and lifecycle stages, allowing for complex interconnections between assets.

The core logic involves:
1. Hash-based deterministic generation ensuring reproducibility
2. Physical appearance systems that validate trait compatibility
3. Temporal existence tracking for assets across time zones
4. Spatial coordinate mapping for 3D world positioning
5. Event-driven narrative progression tied to both time and location

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **WorldGenerator**: Creates complete world definitions with genre, theme, and metadata.
- **AssetCreator**: Produces diverse asset types (buildings, characters, flora, fauna) with linked physical appearances.
- **TimelineBuilder**: Generates chronological event sequences tied to spatial locations.
- **SpatialMapper**: Assigns 3D coordinates to assets and locations.
- **StoryCompiler**: Assembles narrative chapters from generated assets and events.
- **HashResolver**: Determines consistent outputs for identical input hashes.
- **AppearanceValidator**: Ensures compatibility between character traits and physical forms.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (frontend framework), Node.js (backend runtime), JSON/Markdown libraries, 3D coordinate systems, deterministic hash algorithms (likely cryptographic hashes), temporal event scheduling libraries.

### USAGE
1. Input a generation seed (hash) to create reproducible worlds
2. Specify world parameters (genre, theme, description)
3. Generate assets (characters, locations, events) with deterministic hashes
4. Compile narrative chapters from generated content
5. Export as JSON/Markdown files or frontend screenshots

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
>This system demonstrates how deterministic generation can create infinite yet consistent sci-fi universes by using cryptographic hashes as input seeds. The spatial-temporal linking ensures assets naturally interact within the generated world.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
>While the hash-based approach provides reproducibility, complex systems may require additional validation for:
>1. Narrative coherence across generated events
>2. Physical plausibility of generated appearances
>3. Temporal consistency between events and asset lifecycles
>Consider implementing seed-based regeneration for iterative world refinement.
