### SUMMARY
Implements an attention-based collision avoidance system for drones using CBFs to prioritize nearby obstacles and drones.

### DETAILS
This module computes safe trajectories by dynamically allocating attention weights to relevant objects (obstacles or other drones) within a configurable radius. It uses a control barrier function (CBF) to enforce safe distances, ensuring real-time collision avoidance. The system prioritizes nearby objects (higher attention weights) while maintaining a safety margin beyond minimum distances. It logs warnings if required dependencies (`pyswarming` or `uav_collision_avoidance`) are unavailable, falling back to a generic fallback method.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`compute_attention`**: Assigns attention weights to obstacles/drones based on proximity, with closer objects receiving higher weights.
- **`__init__`**: Initializes attention parameters (radius, max objects, safety margins) and internal tracking structures (attention_weights, collision_history).

### DEPENDENCIES
pyswarming (optional), uav_collision_avoidance (optional), numpy, logging

### USAGE
1. Initialize the box with desired parameters (e.g., `attention_radius=10.0`).
2. Call `compute_attention()` with current drone position and lists of obstacles/drones to derive attention weights and safe directions.
3. Integrate `safe_direction` and `attention_weights` into trajectory planning.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Attention Weighting Logic
> Attention weights decay exponentially with distance (implicitly handled via proximity-based prioritization). Objects beyond `attention_radius` are ignored.
>[!WARNING]- Dependency Fallback
> If `pyswarming`/`uav_collision_avoidance` fails, the system defaults to a generic collision-avoidance fallback, potentially reducing precision. Test fallback behavior under edge cases.
