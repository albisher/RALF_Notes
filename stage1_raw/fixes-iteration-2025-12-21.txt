### SUMMARY
Iteration fixes for frontend application data handling, focusing on OSM building conversion, viewer logs, and 2D top-viewer initialization improvements.

### DETAILS
This file contains fixes from an iteration addressing performance and initialization issues in a GIS application. Key changes include:
- **OSM Building Conversion**: Added caching to prevent excessive log messages during OSM building conversion.
- **Viewer Logs**: Enhanced log formatting and error handling for view checks to ensure proper console visibility.
- **2D Top Viewer**: Improved initialization logic with checks for container visibility, retries, and timing adjustments to prevent failures.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **OSM Building Conversion Caching**: Limits redundant log messages during OSM data processing.
- **Container Waiting Logic**: Ensures proper initialization timing and visibility checks for the 2D viewer.
- **View Check Logs**: Structured logs for view transitions to improve debugging.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js, Cesium.js, Plotly.js (for OSM data visualization), OSM API (OpenStreetMap data).

### USAGE
The fixes primarily target frontend initialization and debugging workflows. Developers should:
1. Monitor console logs for conversion and initialization messages.
2. Use the improved error handling to diagnose 2D viewer initialization issues.
3. Verify container visibility and dimensions before attempting viewer initialization.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The 2D top viewer initialization still fails but with better error logging. Check browser DevTools for detailed error messages about container visibility or dimensions.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure `osmViewEnabled` is correctly set to `true` in Quad View to avoid premature skipping of viewer initialization. Misconfiguration may lead to redundant checks or missed visualizations.
