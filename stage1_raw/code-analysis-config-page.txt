### SUMMARY
Analyzes discrepancies between expected and actual behavior of a drone swarm configuration UI component, highlighting missing interactive testing and a critical dropdown error.

### DETAILS
This document compares the intended structure of the `DronesBaseConfigViewComponent` with its current browser implementation. While the component renders all expected sections (header, base config, swarm/squad organization, naming convention dropdown), critical interactive functionality remains untested. The primary issue is a dropdown error where the "Lettered" naming convention option fails to load, despite the component expecting valid values.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`DronesBaseConfigViewComponent`**: Manages swarm and base drone configuration UI.
- **`Base Configuration Section`**: Handles inputs for base name, position, concurrency, and communication range.
- **`Swarm & Squad Organization Section`**: Provides buttons to add/delete swarms/squads and displays their lists.
- **`Naming Convention Dropdown`**: Should allow selection between "numbered" and "lettered" naming schemes.

### DEPENDENCIES
React (Vue-like syntax), JavaScript (ES6+), UI framework components (likely React-based UI library).

### USAGE
The component is used in `/config` to configure drone swarm and base settings. Users interact with inputs, buttons, and dropdowns to set configurations, but testing for interactivity is absent.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Dropdown Issue
> The "Lettered" naming convention option in the dropdown is not rendering, causing a runtime error. The component expects valid `value` attributes (`"numbered"` and `"lettered"`), but the UI displays a misleading placeholder ("Lettered (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...)"), which suggests a mismatch between expected and rendered options.
>[!WARNING]- Missing Interactive Testing
> No user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons, selecting dropdowns) have been validated. This leaves critical UI functionality untested, increasing the risk of undetected bugs in real-world usage.
