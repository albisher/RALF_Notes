### SUMMARY
Research and implementation notes for fast procedural generation of low-resolution 2D top-view world types, including space stations, ships, asteroids, and moons.

### DETAILS
This document outlines fast procedural generation methods for specialized low-resolution 2D top-view world types using deterministic hashing and modular grid-based approaches. The code leverages NumPy and SHA-256 hashing to create deterministic layouts for space stations, ships, asteroids, and moons. Each world type employs distinct algorithms:
- **Space stations** use modular grid sections with vertical deck levels for habitation, industrial, docking, and core systems.
- **Space ships** adopt a horizontal compartment-based structure with distinct section types (bow, crew, cargo, engine, core).
- **Asteroids** generate irregular fragmented surfaces using noise-based distance calculations from a central core.
- **Moons** (not fully detailed here) would likely use cratered surface generation with depth layers.

The algorithms prioritize speed by using hash-based randomization and simple grid traversal, ensuring consistent layouts across runs with the same seed.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **generate_space_station_fast**: Creates modular grid-based space station layouts with vertical deck levels.
- **generate_space_ship_fast**: Produces horizontal compartment-based ship layouts with section-specific deck levels.
- **generate_asteroid_fast**: Generates irregular asteroid surfaces using noise-based distance calculations from a center.
- **generate_noise_fast**: (Implicitly referenced) Helper function for noise generation in asteroid creation (not shown in snippet).

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, hashlib

### USAGE
1. **Input**: A base hash string and optional width/height parameters (default 200x200).
2. **Output**: A NumPy array representing the procedural layout (values between 0.0–1.0 indicating deck/core levels).
3. **Example**:
   ```python
   station_map = generate_space_station_fast("seed123")
   ship_map = generate_space_ship_fast("seed456")
   ```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Deterministic Hashing
> Each function uses SHA-256 hashing to ensure reproducible layouts with the same seed. The first 8 hex digits of the hash (`base_hash[:8]`) are converted to an integer for modular arithmetic.
>[!WARNING]- Noise Dependency
> The asteroid generation relies on an external `generate_noise_fast` function (not provided). Implement this with a fast noise algorithm (e.g., Perlin noise) for accurate results.
