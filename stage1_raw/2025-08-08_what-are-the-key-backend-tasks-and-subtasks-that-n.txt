### SUMMARY
Identifies backend tasks for a Space Pearl World-Building application, focusing on Flask API endpoints, database operations, AI integration, and backend services.

### DETAILS
The research outlines structured backend tasks for the Space Pearl application, excluding frontend components. Key areas include:
- **Flask API Endpoints**: Development of RESTful endpoints for entities like Timelines, TimelineEvents, and Users, with emphasis on CRUD operations, validation, and security.
- **Database Operations**: SQLAlchemy model design, migrations, relationship management, and performance optimization (e.g., indexing, caching).
- **AI Integration**: Backend services for AI-driven world-building, using asynchronous task queues (e.g., Celery) and secure API handling.
- **Backend Services**: Infrastructure setup (Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis), security, logging, and CI/CD pipelines.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Flask Blueprints**: Organize API routes for domain entities.
- **SQLAlchemy Models**: Define database schemas with relationships.
- **Celery Tasks**: Handle long-running AI operations asynchronously.
- **Alembic Migrations**: Manage schema versioning.
- **Flask-RESTful/Smorest**: Structured API development framework.
- **Redis Caching**: Improve performance for frequent queries.
- **Flask-JWT/HTTPAuth**: Authentication and authorization middleware.

### DEPENDENCIES
Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-Smorest, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, PyJWT, Flask-HTTPAuth, Docker, Nginx.

### USAGE
To implement these tasks:
1. Set up a Flask backend with Dockerized PostgreSQL/Redis.
2. Define SQLAlchemy models and implement Alembic migrations.
3. Create Flask Blueprints with CRUD endpoints for each entity.
4. Integrate AI services via Celery for async processing.
5. Secure endpoints with JWT/HTTPAuth and validate inputs.
6. Optimize queries with indexing and caching.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Database Relationships**
> Ensure proper foreign key constraints and indexes are defined in SQLAlchemy models to maintain data integrity and performance. For example, `TimelineEvent` should link to `Timeline`, `WorldElement`, and `Location` with appropriate constraints.

>[!WARNING]- **Security Risks**
> Always validate all user inputs and sanitize API responses to prevent SQL injection, XSS, or other injection attacks. Use Flask’s built-in error handling to return consistent API responses for errors.
