### SUMMARY
Assessment log documenting initial structural integrity checks of a planetary habitat module (X7) during construction.

### DETAILS
This log records the first structural integrity evaluation of a newly constructed habitat module (X7) on a planetary surface (31.0° N, 33.9° E). The assessment confirms that construction materials are holding under local gravity and atmospheric conditions, with nominal energy consumption from a linked module (X5). Auxiliary support struts are functioning as expected, but the log includes a question about material suitability. The task includes running stress tests on key components and verifying proper module alignment for safety.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Structural Integrity Check**: Verifies material stability under planetary conditions.
- **Stress Test Execution**: Evaluates component resilience to expected loads.
- **Module Alignment Verification**: Ensures all sections are securely held for safety.

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed (assumes reliance on local construction materials and linked module X5 for energy).

### USAGE
This log serves as a baseline for future structural assessments. Engineers should:
1. Run predefined stress tests on critical components.
2. Monitor module alignment and deployment of auxiliary struts.
3. Reassess material suitability if anomalies persist.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Material Suitability Query
> The log explicitly questions whether the chosen construction materials are appropriate for the habitat’s operational environment. Further material testing may be warranted.
>[!WARNING]- Alignment Verification Criticality
> Failure to confirm proper module alignment could compromise structural integrity during stress tests or operational phases. Double-check deployment of auxiliary struts.
