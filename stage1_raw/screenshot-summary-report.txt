### SUMMARY
Documentation report for a Space Pearl World Builder web application, detailing automated screenshot captures of all features using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This report documents a comprehensive UI testing process where 21 screenshots were captured for a Space Pearl World Builder web application. The screenshots cover authentication, dashboard, world management, character creation, and user journeys, ensuring all features are visually documented. The process used Puppeteer to automate screenshot generation with standardized naming conventions and storage in a designated directory.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Puppeteer Automation**: Captures UI screenshots programmatically.
- **Feature Coverage**: Validates all major UI components (login, dashboard, world management, etc.).
- **Authentication Testing**: Verifies login workflow and JWT-based access.
- **User Journey Validation**: Ensures seamless navigation across pages.
- **Screenshot Naming & Storage**: Organizes files using `YYYYMMDD-####` convention in `screenshots/ui-checks/`.

### DEPENDENCIES
Puppeteer, Chrome browser, Node.js runtime, local web application (Space Pearl World Builder), JSON Web Token (JWT) library for authentication.

### USAGE
To replicate this process:
1. Install Puppeteer and Chrome.
2. Configure Puppeteer to target the Space Pearl web app at `https://localhost:8443`.
3. Use test credentials (`test/testpass`) to log in via `/api/auth/login`.
4. Run Puppeteer scripts to capture screenshots at specified resolutions (1280x720).
5. Save files in `./screenshots/ui-checks/` with standardized naming.
