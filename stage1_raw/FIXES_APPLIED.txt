### SUMMARY
Documentation of fixes applied to improve LiDAR 3D object detection by adjusting vertical field of view, lowering altitude, and implementing frontier-based exploration.

### DETAILS
This document details the root causes of LiDAR visualization failing to detect objects in 3D space due to narrow vertical field of view (±15°) and high altitude (8-12m), which caused rays to miss small objects. The fixes included asymmetric vertical FOV adjustment (-30° to +5°), lowering waypoint altitudes to 3-6m, and introducing frontier-based exploration for adaptive waypoint generation. These changes enhance LiDAR point cloud coverage and enable autonomous 3D object detection.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`simple_exploration_test.py` (lines 321, 580-586)**: Modified LiDAR vertical angles and waypoint altitudes.
- **`frontier_exploration.py`**: Implements autonomous frontier-based exploration with adaptive waypoints.
- **`research/EXPLORATION_ALGORITHMS_RESEARCH.md`**: Documentation of explored exploration algorithms.

### DEPENDENCIES
`numpy`, `docker`, `simulation/docker/docker-compose.yml`, `scenarios/exploration/visualization/visualize_exploration.py`

### USAGE
Apply fixes by:
1. Updating `simple_exploration_test.py` with new vertical angles and waypoints.
2. Enabling frontier exploration via `use_frontier_exploration = True`.
3. Running simulations via Docker commands to verify 3D point cloud coverage.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Insight
> The asymmetric FOV (-30° to +5°) improves downward ray coverage, critical for detecting objects at lower altitudes.
>[!WARNING]- Altitude Limitation
> Objects at 4m altitude with -30° FOV require careful tuning to avoid ground occlusion while maximizing detection range.
