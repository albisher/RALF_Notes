### SUMMARY
Refactored an elements page into assets with interactive cards and detailed asset pages, enhancing user experience with clickable navigation and type-specific features.

### DETAILS
This file documents a complete refactoring of an application's elements management system into an assets system. The project replaced the `/elements` route with `/assets`, introduced clickable asset cards that navigate to detailed pages, and implemented comprehensive asset detail views. The implementation includes type-specific sections (e.g., character, robot, building), visual feedback for hover/click actions, and bilingual support (English/Arabic). The refactor also improved navigation, added edit/delete functionality, and enhanced visual design with icons and colors tailored to asset types.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Route Refactoring**: Updated `/elements` to `/assets` with new `/assets/:id` routes for detail pages.
- **Assets.vue**: Main component rendering clickable asset cards with hover effects and navigation.
- **AssetDetail.vue**: Detailed view of individual assets with type-specific data displays.
- **Asset Card Navigation**: Cards trigger route transitions to asset detail pages using `@click` events.
- **Type-Specific Data**: Dynamic rendering of asset data based on `element_type` (e.g., character, robot).
- **Bilingual UI**: Supports English ("Assets") and Arabic ("الأصول") translations.
- **Edit/Delete Actions**: Inline buttons with `@click.stop` to prevent unintended navigation.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (3.x), Vuetify (for UI components), Vue Router, Webpack, Babel, i18n (for translations), Material Design Icons (for asset icons).

### USAGE
1. Replace `/elements` routes with `/assets` and `/assets/:id` routes in the router configuration.
2. Update component names (`Elements.vue` → `Assets.vue`) and references to "elements" to "assets."
3. Implement clickable asset cards in `Assets.vue` with navigation logic.
4. Develop `AssetDetail.vue` with type-specific data sections and related assets.
5. Apply visual feedback (hover effects, cursor pointers) and action buttons (edit/delete).
6. Ensure bilingual support by translating UI elements and updating navigation.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The refactored system maintains backward compatibility for existing asset data but requires migration of UI references from "elements" to "assets." Ensure all legacy code references are updated before full deployment.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> When implementing type-specific sections (e.g., robot/character), validate data structures to avoid rendering errors for unsupported asset types. Use conditional rendering (`v-if`) to dynamically display relevant fields.
