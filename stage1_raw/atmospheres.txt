### SUMMARY
Describes diverse atmospheric compositions and extreme conditions found across celestial bodies, planets, and exotic environments.

### DETAILS
This file categorizes various atmospheric types, ranging from breathable to toxic, based on gas composition, density, and environmental hazards. It highlights extremes like dense carbon dioxide atmospheres, corrosive vapors, and plasma states, useful for planetary science, astrobiology, and space exploration studies.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Atmospheric Classification**: Defines broad categories of atmospheres by composition (e.g., oxygen-rich, noble gas mix).
- **Extreme Environment Mapping**: Documents hazardous conditions (e.g., radioactive mist, lightning storms) for risk assessment.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Provides contrasts between breathable and toxic atmospheres for scientific reference.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
Referenced in planetary science research, exoplanet studies, or engineering designs for space habitats. Useful for identifying atmospheric hazards or designing probes/rovers for exploration.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> These classifications help distinguish between habitable and uninhabitable atmospheres, critical for identifying potential life-support conditions or contamination risks.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Many listed conditions (e.g., radioactive mist, corrosive vapors) require specialized protective measures in robotic or human missions. Avoid direct exposure without mitigation.
