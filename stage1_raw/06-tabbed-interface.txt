### SUMMARY
Design iteration for converting a 3-column layout into a tabbed interface to improve organization and reduce clutter in a timeline application.

### DETAILS
This design iteration converts the existing 3-column layout into a tabbed interface, where each tab (Events, Editor, Settings, Statistics) displays distinct content. The tabbed approach enhances usability by consolidating related functionalities into cohesive sections, reducing visual noise and improving content focus. The implementation leverages Vue.js components for dynamic tab switching and content rendering, ensuring modularity and scalability.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Tabbed Interface Component**: Manages tab navigation, active tab state, and conditional rendering of child tabs.
- **EventsTab**: Displays a list of events with clickable items to select events for editing.
- **EditorTab**: Provides an editor form for creating or modifying events, conditionally rendering based on selected event.
- **SettingsTab**: Handles timeline settings configuration with save functionality.
- **StatisticsTab**: Shows analytics or statistics derived from the timeline events.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (3.x), Vuex (for state management), Composition API, Tailwind CSS (for styling), Event components (e.g., `EventItem`, `EventEditorForm`).

### USAGE
1. **Setup**: Import and register the `TabbedTimelineInterface` component in your Vue application.
2. **Data Binding**: Pass `tabs`, `timelineNodes`, `selectedEvent`, and `timelineSettings` as props.
3. **Event Handling**: Use `@event-selected`, `@save`, and other custom events for interactions.
4. **Dynamic Rendering**: The component conditionally renders tabs based on `activeTab` state.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Tabs
> Editor tab dynamically shows content based on the selected event, ensuring users can edit without losing context of the event list.
>[!WARNING]- Tab Switching Overhead
> Users may experience slight delays in switching tabs, especially if content re-renders. Consider lazy-loading or caching content for smoother transitions.
>[!INFO]- Badges for Status
> Implementing badges (e.g., "Settings (1)") can help users quickly identify unsaved changes or pending actions, improving workflow efficiency.
