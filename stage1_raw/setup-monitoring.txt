### SUMMARY
Script to initialize monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana via Docker Compose.

### DETAILS
This script automates the creation of a basic monitoring setup by generating a `docker-compose.yml` file that includes containers for Prometheus (for metrics collection) and Grafana (for visualization). It outputs a confirmation message after generating the configuration file without executing any actual container setup.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`echo` commands**: Prints status messages to inform the user of script progress.
- **`docker-compose.yml` generation**: Implicitly creates a configuration file for monitoring containers (not explicitly shown in script).

### DEPENDENCIES
Docker, Docker Compose (must be installed and available in PATH).

### USAGE
1. Save the script as `setup-monitoring.sh`.
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x setup-monitoring.sh`.
3. Run it: `./setup-monitoring.sh`.
4. Manually edit the generated `docker-compose.yml` to configure Prometheus/Grafana sources and targets.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script only generates a skeleton `docker-compose.yml` file. Actual monitoring deployment requires additional configuration (e.g., defining services, volumes, and network mappings) and running `docker-compose up`.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are running before executing this script. Errors may occur if dependencies are missing.
