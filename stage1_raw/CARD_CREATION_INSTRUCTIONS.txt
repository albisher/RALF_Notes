### SUMMARY
Instructions for creating 100 cards via a mix of automated script and manual UI input.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a two-step process to generate 100 cards: 95 programmatically via a JavaScript script executed in the browser console, and 5 manually through the UI’s Generate Stage feature. The script automates the creation of diverse card types with metadata, while the manual step allows customization via a UI interface. The workflow ensures all cards are verified in the Cards tab, confirming correct functionality and representation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **create95CardsProgrammatic()**: Executes the automated script to generate 95 cards with predefined attributes (types, names, descriptions, coordinates, tags).
- **Generate Stage UI**: Manually creates 5 cards via a UI workflow with hash-based generation and dropdown selection.
- **Browser Console Script (create_95_cards_browser.js)**: Contains logic to programmatically fetch/create cards with structured metadata.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Browser-based frontend application (React-based, running on `localhost:5174`).
- JavaScript runtime environment (Chrome/Firefox console).
- UI components: Login credentials (`a/spq8`), Generate Stage button, Cards tab.

### USAGE
1. **Programmatic Step**:
   - Access `http://localhost:5174`, log in, open console, paste `create_95_cards_browser.js`, and run `create95CardsProgrammatic()`.
   - Wait for completion (~2-3 minutes) and verify progress in console.

2. **Manual Step**:
   - Navigate to Generate Stage, select a world, and manually generate 5 cards using the recommended generator types.
   - Save each card and verify success messages.

3. **Verification**:
   - Check the Cards tab for 100 cards, verify counts/types, and test UI functionality (search, filters, modal, edit/delete).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the backend API supports dynamic card creation with metadata fields (e.g., coordinates, tags). If missing, adjust script to match API constraints.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Manual card creation may conflict with programmatically generated cards if hashes overlap. Ensure unique hashes are used for UI-generated cards to avoid duplicates.
