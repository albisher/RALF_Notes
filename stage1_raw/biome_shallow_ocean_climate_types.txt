### SUMMARY
Describes climate classification for shallow ocean biomes and their environmental conditions.

### DETAILS
This file likely defines or categorizes climate types specific to shallow marine environments, such as temperature, salinity, light exposure, and seasonal variations. Shallow ocean biomes (e.g., coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds) rely on distinct climatic factors that influence biodiversity, primary productivity, and ecosystem stability. The content may map environmental gradients (e.g., tropical vs. temperate) to functional roles of organisms within these zones.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Climate Gradient Mapping**: Classifies shallow ocean regions by temperature, light, and nutrient availability.
- **Ecosystem Function Assignment**: Links climate types to dominant biotic interactions (e.g., coral reef resilience vs. mangrove salt tolerance).

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone documentation or metadata)

### USAGE
Referenced in ecological modeling, marine conservation assessments, or biodiversity studies to contextualize shallow ocean conditions. May integrate with GIS or climate data tools for spatial analysis.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Note
> Shallow ocean climate types often correlate with latitude, depth, and human disturbances (e.g., coastal development). This file may outline thresholds for defining "shallow" (e.g., <20m depth) and associated abiotic constraints.
>[!WARNING]- Interpretation Caution
> Ambiguous terms like "aquatic" here may imply broader marine contexts; verify specificity to shallow zones vs. open ocean.
