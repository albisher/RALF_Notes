### SUMMARY
Documentation for beta access setup, including URLs, card status, and next steps for accessing and managing a beta environment with Dockerized backend and frontend components.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the setup of a beta environment for a project hosted on `localhost`. It includes details about the created world, converted cards, Docker containers, and accessible URLs for the UI and backend API. The setup includes a production UI with all core features, a backend API, and frontend components. The card status indicates 31 successfully created cards out of 77 total mock cards, with 30 errors due to timestamp formatting issues.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Primary UI-Beta (Production UI)**: Main interface for generating, linking, editing, and exporting cards/stories.
- **Backend API Direct**: Endpoint for direct API interactions (ID: `5001`).
- **Backend API via Proxy**: Proxy endpoint for API access (ID: `8888/api`).
- **Frontend (Vue Dev)**: Development frontend interface (ID: `5173`).
- **Health Check**: Endpoint to verify backend health (ID: `8888/health`).
- **Card Stage**: UI component for viewing, editing, and managing cards in the selected world.

### DEPENDENCIES
Docker, Node.js, Express.js (for backend API), Vue.js (for frontend), and a database (likely PostgreSQL or similar).

### USAGE
1. Access the UI via `http://localhost:8888/ui-beta/` to interact with the beta environment.
2. Navigate to the **Card stage** to view/edit cards in the world **"Space Peral" (ID: 38)**.
3. Use the backend API directly or via proxy for programmatic interactions.
4. Manually fix timestamp errors in the UI if needed.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The backend API is exposed both directly (`localhost:5001/api`) and via proxy (`localhost:8888/api`). Ensure your application routes requests correctly to avoid conflicts.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The 30 timestamp errors may cause partial functionality. Verify card data integrity by editing problematic cards manually in the UI.
