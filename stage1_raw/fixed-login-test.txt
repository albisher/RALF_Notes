### SUMMARY
Automated login and UI verification test suite using Puppeteer to validate login functionality and authenticated page navigation.

### DETAILS
This script implements a `FixedLoginTest` class that automates a login flow and verifies subsequent authenticated page navigation. It uses Puppeteer to interact with a web application, captures screenshots for debugging, and logs test progress. The test employs predefined credentials (`test/testpass`) and systematically checks connection, login success, and access to multiple authenticated routes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`constructor()`**: Initializes test configurations (base URL, credentials, screenshot directory).
- **`init()`**: Sets up directory for screenshots and logs initialization details.
- **`getScreenshotName(feature, description)`**: Generates timestamped filenames for screenshots.
- **`takeScreenshot(page, feature, description)`**: Captures page snapshots with error handling.
- **`testBasicConnection(page)`**: Validates connection to the base URL and checks page title.
- **`testLoginFlow(page)`**: Executes login with credential validation and checks redirect success.
- **`testAuthenticatedPages(page)`**: Navigates to a list of authenticated routes, verifying each page loads.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Initialize the test with `new FixedLoginTest()`.
2. Call `init()` to prepare screenshots directory.
3. Use `testBasicConnection()` and `testLoginFlow()` to run specific tests.
4. For authenticated pages, call `testAuthenticatedPages()` to verify all routes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `test/testpass` credentials, which may not reflect production security policies. Always validate credentials in staging environments.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Screenshot filenames include timestamps and counters, which could generate many files. Consider limiting test runs or adding cleanup logic to avoid cluttering directories.
