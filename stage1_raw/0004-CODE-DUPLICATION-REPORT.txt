### SUMMARY
Identifies critical code duplication across simulation and testing files, requiring refactoring to improve maintainability and efficiency.

### DETAILS
This report documents extensive code duplication (32.6%) in an autonomous exploration simulation system, primarily between `test.py` and `live.py` files. Duplicated components include core classes like `AutonomousExplorationDrone` and `GroundTruthLogger`, along with utility functions like `create_3d_plot()` and `_lidar_scan()`. The duplication stems from nearly identical implementations across different environments, with minimal functional variations (e.g., logging enhancements). The analysis highlights redundant logic, such as identical initialization methods and scan/update procedures, which could be consolidated into a single source.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **AutonomousExplorationDrone**: Core drone class with identical implementations in `scenarios/autonomous_exploration_test.py` and `simulation/autonomous_exploration_live.py`, differing only in logging integration.
- **GroundTruthLogger**: Fully duplicated class in `scenarios/simple_exploration_test.py` and `simulation/autonomous_exploration_live.py`, with no functional divergence.
- **create_3d_plot()**: Nearly identical plotting function in `test.py` and `live.py`, differing by ~5% in parameter handling.
- **spawn_random_objects()**: Identical function in `simple.py` and `live.py`, requiring consolidation.
- **_lidar_scan()**: Fully duplicated utility across `simple.py`, `test.py`, and `live.py`.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (internal to the simulation system; no external libraries referenced in the duplication report).

### USAGE
To address duplication, refactor duplicated classes/functions into a shared base module (e.g., `core/drone_utils.py`). Use conditional logic to conditionally enable environment-specific features (e.g., logging_box) while abstracting common logic.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Impact
> Duplication reduces maintainability and increases risk of inconsistencies. Consolidating shared logic into a single source will reduce redundancy by ~32.6%.
>[!WARNING]- Testing Implications
> Live vs. test implementations differ only in logging, but identical core logic may introduce subtle bugs if not carefully aligned during refactoring. Test logging should be preserved as a distinct feature.
