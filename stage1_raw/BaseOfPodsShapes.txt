### SUMMARY
A list of predefined 3D pod shape types used for modeling or design purposes.

### DETAILS
This file appears to enumerate basic 3D geometric shapes that could be used as foundational elements for pod designs, such as in architecture, robotics, or game development. The shapes listed (`sphere`, `cylinder`, `egg`, `semi-sphere`, `dome`) represent common volumetric forms that can be parameterized or combined to create more complex structures.

The list likely serves as input for procedural generation, collision detection, or visualization systems where these shapes are dynamically instantiated or modified.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`sphere`**: Represents a perfectly symmetrical 3D circular shape, often used for rounded pods or spherical components.
- **`cylinder`**: A tubular shape with two circular bases, useful for cylindrical storage or structural elements.
- **`egg`**: A teardrop-like shape, resembling an elongated egg, often used for aerodynamic or stylistic design.
- **`semi-sphere`**: Half of a sphere, useful for curved surfaces like domes or half-shells.
- **`dome`**: A curved, upward-facing shape resembling a hemisphere, often used for architectural or decorative elements.

*(Note: No explicit functions/classes are defined in this snippet; it appears to be a static list.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone list, no external libraries or modules referenced)

### USAGE
This list is likely consumed by a system that:
1. Takes these shapes as input for procedural generation (e.g., generating pod designs programmatically).
2. Applies transformations (scaling, rotation) or composes them into larger structures.
3. Uses collision detection or rendering libraries to visualize or interact with these shapes dynamically.

Example hypothetical usage:
```python
shapes = ["sphere", "cylinder", "egg"]
for shape in shapes:
    generate_pod_component(shape)  # Pseudocode
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Role
> These shapes are often used in **pod design systems** (e.g., for drones, vehicles, or modular structures) where modularity and customization are key. The list may be extended with additional shapes like `torus` or `prism` for broader applicability.

>[!WARNING]- Static Nature
> This is a **static list**—no runtime logic is implied. For dynamic use, this data would typically be loaded from a configuration file, database, or API. Hardcoding here may limit flexibility in future iterations.
