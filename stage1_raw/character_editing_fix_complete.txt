### SUMMARY
Fixes the incomplete character editing functionality by implementing a complete edit dialog, backend update endpoint, and reactive data handling in a character management system.

### DETAILS
This file documents the complete fix for a character editing feature that was previously showing a placeholder message. The solution involved:
1. Adding a functional edit dialog component in Vue.js to handle character updates with fields for name, description, role, and traits.
2. Implementing the `editCharacter` and `saveCharacter` functions to load and update character data.
3. Creating a backend PUT endpoint in Python (Flask) to handle character updates securely with JWT authentication.
4. Ensuring reactive state management for the edit dialog and form validation.

The fix was verified through API and UI testing, confirming successful character updates and proper dialog functionality.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **editCharacter**: Loads character data into the edit form and opens the dialog.
- **saveCharacter**: Validates form data, updates the character via the backend, and handles success/error feedback.
- **update_character (backend)**: Handles the PUT request to update a character's attributes.
- **showEditCharacterDialog**: Reactive boolean to control the edit dialog visibility.
- **editForm**: Reactive form state for character editing fields.
- **editingCharacter**: Reactive reference to track the character being edited.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (frontend), Flask (backend), SQLAlchemy (database ORM), JWT (authentication), Vuetify (UI components), `uiStore` and `charactersStore` (custom Vuex stores).

### USAGE
1. **Frontend**: Call `editCharacter(character)` to open the edit dialog for a specific character.
2. **Backend**: Ensure the `/api/characters/<id>` route is properly configured with a PUT method to handle updates.
3. **Testing**: Use provided test scripts (`test-character-api.js`, `test-character-editing.js`) to verify functionality.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The edit dialog uses reactive state management (`ref`) to handle dynamic updates. Ensure Vuex stores (`uiStore`, `charactersStore`) are properly initialized with loading/error states for seamless UX.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The backend endpoint requires JWT authentication. Ensure the token is validated before processing updates to prevent unauthorized modifications. The `update_character` function checks for character existence and rolls back transactions on errors.
