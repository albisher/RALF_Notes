### SUMMARY
Fixes syntax errors in OSM buildings conversion logic by resolving mismatched try-catch blocks and scope issues.

### DETAILS
The fix addressed a `SyntaxError` caused by duplicate and improperly nested try-catch blocks in `app-data.js`. The original code had multiple nested blocks, mismatched braces, and variables (`osmBuildings`) referenced outside their scope. The solution removed redundant blocks, restructured nested logic, and ensured proper variable scoping by moving logging statements inside the `try` block where `osmBuildings` was defined.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`try-catch` block restructuring**: Consolidated nested try-catch logic to eliminate syntax errors.
- **Variable scope correction**: Moved logging statements inside the `if` block where `osmBuildings` is accessible.
- **Mismatched braces fix**: Ensured all braces (`{}`) are properly closed and matched.

### DEPENDENCIES
`window.loggingBox`, OSM data parsing logic (internal to `simulation/frontend/`).

### USAGE
The fix was applied retroactively to resolve runtime errors during OSM buildings conversion. The corrected code now properly handles errors and maintains variable scope without syntax issues.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Scope Correction**
> Logging statements were moved from outside the `try` block to inside the `if` block where `osmBuildings` is defined to avoid scope-related errors.
>[!WARNING]- **Duplicate Catch Block**
> The original code had a redundant `catch` block outside the primary `try` block, which caused a syntax error. The fix removed it to align with the intended logic flow.
