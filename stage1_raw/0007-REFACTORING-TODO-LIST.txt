### SUMMARY
A phased refactoring TODO list for autonomous exploration systems to improve modularity and reduce code duplication.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a **3-week phased refactoring plan** to achieve **90%+ compliance with the Box Pattern**, eliminating redundant code across simulation modules. Phase 1 focuses on **critical boxes** (Weeks 1–3) by creating reusable components like `LiDARScannerBox`, `VisualizationBox`, and `GroundTruthLoggerBox`. Each task targets specific files, removes duplication, and ensures modularity while maintaining functionality. The goal is to reduce redundant lines by consolidating logic into standardized classes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **LiDARScannerBox**: Handles LiDAR sensor operations (ray casting, noise simulation, scan statistics).
- **VisualizationBox**: Manages 3D plot generation, point cloud rendering, and path visualization with configurable styles.
- **GroundTruthLoggerBox**: Logs and exports ground-truth data for validation in autonomous exploration scenarios.

### DEPENDENCIES
- `/simulation/swarm/boxes/` (parent directory for new box classes)
- `PyBullet` (for physics testing)
- `matplotlib`/`plotly` (for visualization plotting)
- `scenarios/simple_exploration_test.py`, `autonomous_exploration_test.py`, `autonomous_exploration_live.py` (targeted files for updates)

### USAGE
1. **Implement Phase 1 tasks sequentially** (critical boxes first).
2. **Replace legacy functions** (e.g., `_lidar_scan()`) with new box instances.
3. **Test each box** in isolation before merging into scenarios.
4. **Validate all scenarios** post-refactoring to ensure no regression.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Impact
> Eliminating 210+ lines of duplication in **LiDARScannerBox** alone reduces redundancy significantly, improving maintainability and scalability for future swarm expansions.
>[!WARNING]- Testing Priority
> **PyBullet physics testing** is mandatory for `LiDARScannerBox`—skipping this risks introducing physics inconsistencies in real-world simulations.
>[!INFO]- Style Configuration
> `VisualizationBox` must support **dark/light/professional** themes to avoid hardcoding colors, ensuring flexibility for different use cases.
