### SUMMARY
Implements a toast notification system to replace deprecated `alert()` popups in a Vue.js application, enhancing user experience with non-blocking, visually appealing notifications.

### DETAILS
This implementation replaces legacy `alert()` calls with a centralized toast notification system, improving user experience by eliminating blocking popups and adding structured, animated toasts. The system uses a Vue 3 component (`ToastNotification.vue`) and a singleton service (`toast-service.js`) to manage notifications globally. Components subscribe to the service on mount, displaying toasts in the top-right corner with configurable durations and types (success, error, warning, info). The architecture decouples notification logic from rendering, enabling reusable components and efficient scaling.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **ToastNotification.vue**: Renders toast notifications with animations, auto-dismissal, and type-specific styling.
- **toast-service.js**: Singleton service providing a unified API (`success()`, `error()`, `warning()`, `info()`) for toast management, using a subscriber pattern to decouple display logic from triggering components.
- **App.vue**: Globally integrates the `ToastNotification` component to ensure notifications work across the entire application.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue 3, Vuex (optional for state management), Composition API, CSS animations (e.g., GSAP or native CSS transitions).

### USAGE
1. Import the toast service:
   ```javascript
   import toastService from '@/services/toast-service';
   ```
2. Replace `alert()` calls with service methods:
   ```javascript
   toastService.success('Operation completed!');
   toastService.error('Failed to save: ' + error);
   ```
3. Ensure components subscribe to the service on mount (handled automatically in `ToastNotification.vue`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Subscriber Pattern Benefit**
> The subscriber pattern ensures components can trigger toasts without prop drilling, improving modularity and maintainability. Components only need to emit an event (e.g., `showToast`) to the service, which dispatches the toast globally.

>[!WARNING]- **Manual Dismiss Override Risk**
> If a component manually dismisses a toast before the auto-dismiss timeout, ensure the service’s `dismiss` method is called explicitly to avoid unexpected behavior. This is rare but critical for edge cases.
