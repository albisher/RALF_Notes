### SUMMARY
A specialized UI/UX testing agent designed to conduct comprehensive user experience validation using restricted browser tools, emphasizing usability, accessibility, and workflow analysis.

### DETAILS
The `UI_UX_AGENT` is a specialized AI tool constrained to 26 browser tools, focusing on UI/UX testing beyond basic automation. It evaluates user journeys, identifies friction points, and applies expert-level heuristics (Nielsen’s 10 heuristics, WCAG 2.1 POUR principles) to assess usability, accessibility, and design consistency. The agent prioritizes contextual analysis—such as form validation, error states, and micro-interactions—while adhering to strict tool restrictions (e.g., no file system or terminal access).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **User Journey Analysis**: Tests complete workflows, not isolated interactions, to uncover systemic UX issues.
- **Accessibility Auditing**: Validates compliance with WCAG 2.1 (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast).
- **Performance & SEO Audits**: Runs audits for best practices (e.g., `mcp_browser-tools_runPerformanceAudit`).
- **Micro-Interaction Testing**: Evaluates animations, feedback loops, and error recovery mechanisms.
- **Responsive Design Validation**: Checks behavior across viewport sizes and device types.
- **Error State Analysis**: Assesses form validation, empty states, and loading indicators.
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Applies Nielsen’s usability heuristics to identify usability gaps.

### DEPENDENCIES
`mcp_browsermcp_*` (12 tools): Browser navigation, clicks, typing, waits, and snapshots.
`mcp_browser-tools_*` (14 tools): Console logs, screenshots, accessibility/performance audits, and debug modes.

### USAGE
1. **Define Expert Role**: Frame prompts as a senior UI/UX specialist (e.g., "Act as a WCAG auditor").
2. **Provide Context**: Include design systems, user personas, and constraints (e.g., "Target WCAG 2.1 AA").
3. **Decompose Tasks**: Break evaluations into phases (e.g., navigation → forms → accessibility).
4. **Use Frameworks**: Explicitly reference heuristics (Nielsen/WCAG) or best practices (e.g., "Aesthetic Minimalism").
5. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on agent feedback (e.g., "Identify friction points in this workflow").

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Tool Restriction
> The agent **cannot** use any tools outside the 26-browser-tool limit, including extensions, file I/O, or code execution. Always verify tool usage explicitly in prompts.
>[!WARNING]- Context Dependency
> Without detailed context (e.g., design system, user personas), the agent may produce generic or incomplete UX insights. Provide exhaustive background data to maximize accuracy.
>[!INFO]- Heuristic Bias
> The agent’s expertise is tied to structured frameworks (Nielsen/WCAG). Prompts must explicitly reference these to avoid superficial analysis. Example: "Evaluate against WCAG 2.1 POUR principles."
