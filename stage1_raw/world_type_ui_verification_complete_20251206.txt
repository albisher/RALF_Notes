### SUMMARY
Finalized world type map generation system with bug fixes and UI verification, ensuring deterministic outputs based on world type and hash.

### DETAILS
This code file documents the completion of a **world type map generation system**, integrating multiple generators (Voronoi, heightmap, city placement, biome calculation) with enhanced cloud_world support. The system dynamically adjusts map features (terrain, biomes, cities) based on `world_type` and `world_description`. A critical bug—where `world_type` was omitted from API requests—was identified and fixed in `map_generator_service_box.js`, ensuring proper data flow from UI to backend. The implementation relies on hash-based determinism, guaranteeing consistent outputs for identical inputs across different world types. UI verification confirmed accessibility of key components, though full end-to-end testing awaits world selection.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **WorldTypeVoronoiGenerator**: Generates cell distributions tailored to `world_type`.
- **WorldTypeHeightmapGenerator**: Produces terrain patterns specific to `world_type`.
- **WorldTypeCityPlacer**: Assigns city names/types based on `world_type`.
- **WorldTypeBiomeCalculator**: Computes biome/region types with cloud_world support.
- **map_generator.py**: Orchestrates all components with `world_type` and `world_description` inputs.
- **map_generator_service_box.js**: Fixed fetch body to include `world_type` and `world_description` (previously missing).

### DEPENDENCIES
`services/map-generator/engine/*`, `ui-beta/src/boxes/maps/*`, `api.py`, Vue.js (for UI context passing), Node.js (for fetch API calls).

### USAGE
1. **Select a World Type**: Choose from dropdown (e.g., "Planet," "Moon").
2. **Input Hash/Seed**: Provide a deterministic input (e.g., a hash string).
3. **Generate**: Trigger map creation via UI button.
4. **Verify Output**: Confirm the generated map reflects the `world_type` (e.g., Voronoi cells, biome distribution).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Deterministic Guarantee
> Same `hash` + `world_type` always produces identical map outputs, enabling replayable worlds for testing or save/load systems.
>[!WARNING]- Performance Note
> Cloud_world support in `WorldTypeBiomeCalculator` may increase memory usage; monitor for large-scale deployments.
>[!INFO]- UI Accessibility
> Critical bug fix ensures `world_type` is now sent to the API, resolving "Failed to execute 'fetch'" errors during generation.
>[!WARNING]- Testing Gap
> Full UI verification pending world selection; test with actual `world_type` inputs to confirm end-to-end behavior.
