### SUMMARY
Document summarizing test results for a world type map generator, highlighting discrepancies between statistical and visual outputs.

### DETAILS
This file documents a test run for a **World Type Map Generation** system, evaluating different map types (Planet, Galaxy) with metrics like cell count, land/water distribution, and generation time. The test reveals a persistent **statistics-visual rendering mismatch** (e.g., 100% land stats but blue-dominated visuals), alongside minor issues like authentication interruptions and schema errors. The system is incomplete, with pending tests for 6 additional world types (e.g., Cloud World, Solar System).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`generateFullMap`**: Handles map generation logic, previously had a null-width/height bug.
- **`WORLD_EXPECTATIONS`**: Defines target metrics (e.g., land ratio, clustering) for validation.
- **Statistics Calculation**: Computes land/water ratios but diverges from visual rendering.

### DEPENDENCIES
`WORLD_EXPECTATIONS` (internal config), authentication service (intermittent issues), rendering engine (visual discrepancies).

### USAGE
Tested via a web interface (`localhost:5174`), using provided URLs to generate and inspect maps. Remaining tests require manual execution via URLs listed.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Discrepancy**
> The system’s **statistics (100% land) and visuals (blue-dominated)** conflict, indicating a bug in land/water classification logic. Investigate height thresholds or rendering thresholds.
>[!WARNING]- **Authentication Risk**
> Intermittent timeouts suggest session instability. Refresh login or implement retry logic to avoid dropped connections during long runs.
