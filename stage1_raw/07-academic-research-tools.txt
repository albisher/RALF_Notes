### SUMMARY
Document outlining academic tools for simulating and training multi-robot systems, drone swarms, and autonomous agents.

### DETAILS
This document details key research tools used in academic settings for developing and training multi-agent systems, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) and drone swarm applications. It covers simulation frameworks like OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium, RL algorithm libraries (Stable Baselines3, Ray RLlib), and multi-agent environments (PettingZoo, MPE). These tools enable researchers to design, test, and deploy advanced autonomous systems efficiently.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **OpenAI Gym / Gymnasium**: Provides a standardized interface for RL environments, supporting customizable drone and multi-robot simulations.
- **Stable Baselines3**: Offers production-grade RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) with easy integration for training policies.
- **Ray RLlib**: Enables scalable, distributed RL training with multi-agent and production-ready capabilities.
- **PettingZoo**: Facilitates multi-agent RL environments with modular, research-focused designs for swarm dynamics.
- **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)**: Simplifies 2D multi-agent environments for quick prototyping and algorithm testing.

### DEPENDENCIES
Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3, Ray, PettingZoo, NumPy (for MPE).

### USAGE
1. **Installation**: Install via pip (`pip install gymnasium`, `pip install stable-baselines3`, etc.).
2. **Environment Setup**: Define custom environments (e.g., `DroneEnv-v0`) or inherit from PettingZoo’s `AECEnv`.
3. **Training**: Use RL libraries (e.g., `PPO` in Stable-Baselines3) to train agents on simulated swarms.
4. **Evaluation**: Test agents in multi-agent simulations (e.g., PettingZoo’s `step()` and `observe()` methods).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Integration
> OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium is foundational for RL workflows; pair it with Stable-Baselines3 for algorithmic training.
>[!WARNING]- Customization Risk
> Overly complex custom environments (e.g., MPE) may require deep understanding of agent interactions to avoid instability.
