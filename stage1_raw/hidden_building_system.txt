### SUMMARY
A PyBullet-based system for generating hidden buildings to test autonomous exploration and mapping.

### DETAILS
The `HiddenBuildingSystem` class manages static buildings in a PyBullet physics simulator, ensuring they are invisible to command & control (C&C) while accessible to drones via sensor ray casting. It implements a "separation of knowledge" principle: the simulator holds ground truth data, while C&C must discover buildings through sensor inputs alone. The system generates simple rectangular towers with configurable positions, sizes, and IDs, storing their geometry in a structured format for later retrieval.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__(physics_client: int, storage_path: str)`**: Initializes the system with a PyBullet client and directory for ground truth storage.
- **`generate_simple_tower(position: Tuple[float, float, float], size: Tuple[float, float, float], building_id: str)`**: Creates a static rectangular tower with collision and visual shapes, returning its ID for reference.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, pybullet, json, os

### USAGE
1. Instantiate `HiddenBuildingSystem` with a PyBullet client ID and storage path.
2. Call `generate_simple_tower()` to create buildings with customizable dimensions and positions.
3. Retrieve ground truth data from `self.ground_truth_buildings` or saved JSON files in `storage_path`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Ground Truth Storage
> Buildings are stored in `self.ground_truth_buildings` as a dictionary mapping IDs to bounding box coordinates (min/max). The system also creates JSON files in `storage_path` for persistence.
>[!WARNING]- Static Physics
> Buildings are static (mass=0) to avoid simulation instability. Ensure drones use collision detection to avoid collisions with these structures.
