### SUMMARY
Self-contained Docker environment for running PyBullet simulations with pre-installed dependencies, avoiding macOS compilation issues.

### DETAILS
This Docker setup provides an isolated Python environment with PyBullet and all required dependencies pre-installed in a container. It avoids macOS-specific compilation challenges by leveraging Docker’s containerization capabilities. The container uses a lightweight base image (`python:3.10-slim`) and installs packages directly via `pip`, eliminating the need for a virtual environment (`venv`) inside the container. The `simulation/` directory is mounted into the container, enabling live code changes and seamless file access between host and container.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`docker compose build`**: Builds the Docker image with PyBullet and dependencies.
- **`docker compose run --rm simulator python run_simulation.py`**: Executes the main simulation script inside the container.
- **`docker-compose run --rm simulator python verify_requirements.py`**: Validates installed dependencies.
- **`docker-compose run --rm simulator bash`**: Opens an interactive shell inside the container for debugging.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the container configuration, including base image, Python version, and package installation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all dependencies for PyBullet and related libraries.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Docker Compose, Docker CLI, `python:3.10-slim`, PyBullet 3.2.7, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, XQuartz (macOS GUI support).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to the `simulation/` directory and run `docker compose build` to build the image.
2. Use `docker compose run --rm simulator python <script>` to execute simulations (e.g., `run_simulation.py`).
3. For GUI support on macOS, install XQuartz and forward the display (`DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0`).
4. For headless mode, omit the GUI flag (e.g., `--headless`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The container uses a **direct `pip` installation** of packages at the system level, not a virtual environment (`venv`). This ensures compatibility with PyBullet but requires careful dependency management.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> On macOS, **XQuartz must be installed** and `xhost +localhost` enabled for GUI applications to work. Failure to do so will result in display errors.
