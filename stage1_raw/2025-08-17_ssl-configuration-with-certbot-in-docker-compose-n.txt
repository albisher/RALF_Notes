### SUMMARY
Configures SSL/TLS with Certbot in Docker Compose for Nginx reverse proxy, including automatic renewal and HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a Docker Compose setup for Nginx with SSL/TLS certificates managed by Certbot (Let’s Encrypt). The solution involves:
1. **Adding a Certbot container** to auto-obtain and renew certificates via webroot challenge.
2. **Configuring Nginx** to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS and proxy requests securely via TLS.
3. **Automating renewal** with a loop in the Certbot container (every 12 hours) and optional Nginx reload post-renewal.
4. **Mounting shared volumes** for challenge files and certificates between containers.

The setup ensures compliance with modern security standards, including TLS 1.2/1.3 and proper certificate storage.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`certbot` container**: Manages SSL certificate lifecycle (renewal, validation).
- **`nginx` service**: Handles HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection, SSL termination, and backend proxying.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Orchestrates container dependencies and volume mounts.
- **`certbot renew` loop**: Automates certificate renewal before expiration.
- **Nginx reload script**: Applies updated certificates post-renewal.

### DEPENDENCIES
`nginx:latest`, `certbot/certbot:latest`, Docker Compose, Let’s EncEncrypt API.

### USAGE
1. Place the `docker-compose.yml` snippet in your project directory.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start containers.
3. Manually obtain initial certificates with `docker-compose run --rm certbot certonly`.
4. Certificates auto-renew every 12 hours; reload Nginx via `docker-compose exec proxy nginx -s reload` if needed.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Challenge Files
> Nginx must serve `/var/www/certbot/.well-known/acme-challenge/` for Certbot’s HTTP-01 challenge validation. Ensure this path is mounted and writable by both containers.

>[!WARNING]- Certificate Expiry
> Certificates expire every 90 days. While Certbot auto-renews, monitor renewal logs (`docker-compose logs certbot`) to detect failures. Test HTTPS access post-renewal.
