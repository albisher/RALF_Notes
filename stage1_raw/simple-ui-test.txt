### SUMMARY
Automated UI test script for a web application using Puppeteer to interact with and validate user interface elements.

### DETAILS
This script automates a simple UI workflow for a web application, leveraging Puppeteer to launch a browser, navigate to a local web app, and interact with UI elements. It captures screenshots at key stages, logs interactions, and handles errors gracefully. The test sequence includes loading the app, locating and clicking a "Create World" button, filling a form with world details, submitting the form, and navigating to the workspace.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`simpleUITest()`**: Orchestrates the entire UI test workflow, including browser launch, navigation, UI interactions, and screenshot capture.
- **`puppeteer.launch()`**: Configures and starts a browser instance with customizable options (e.g., headless mode, security flags).
- **`page.goto()`**: Navigates to the target URL (`http://localhost:5173`) with timeout and DOM content loading wait.
- **`page.$$()`**: Selects multiple matching elements (e.g., buttons, inputs) using CSS selectors.
- **`page.evaluate()`**: Executes JavaScript in the context of a selected element to extract text/content.
- **`page.screenshot()`**: Captures the page state as a screenshot at specified paths.
- **`page.keyboard.type()`**: Simulates typing into form inputs.
- **`browser.close()`**: Ensures cleanup of the browser process after testing.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer (`npm install puppeteer`).
2. Ensure the target web app is running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Run the script (`node simple-ui-test.js`).
4. Screenshots will be saved in a `screenshots/` directory.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `--disable-web-security` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox`, which may violate security best practices for production environments. Use only in controlled test environments.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The test assumes the UI structure matches expected selectors (e.g., button/textarea IDs). If the app changes, selectors may break, requiring updates to the script.
