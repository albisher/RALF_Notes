### SUMMARY
Explores procedural content generation scope for a web application, focusing on balancing automated and manual creation of characters, environments, stories, and world elements while ensuring consistency and user control.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the scope for procedural content generation within a web application, detailing how different elements—characters, environments, stories, and world-building components—should be dynamically created. The approach prioritizes integration with existing lore, user-defined preferences, and modular generation to avoid overwhelming users. Key considerations include balancing automation with manual oversight, ensuring generated content aligns with lore, and providing granular control over generation parameters (e.g., archetypes, biomes, or temporal adjustments).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Character Generation**: Automatically creates characters with configurable detail levels, archetypes, and relationships to lore.
- **Environmental Generation**: Dynamically generates plants, buildings, and biomes based on location/time, with suggestions tied to exploration logs.
- **Story Generation**: Proposes narrative elements (conflicts, events, plot twists) based on characters, locations, and time, ensuring continuity.
- **World-Building Integration**: Generates new locations/biomes during early phases or with lore editing, enforcing consistency checks.
- **User Control Module**: Allows users to specify generation parameters (e.g., lore overrides, chunked generation) and manually edit content.

### DEPENDENCIES
user-input-library, procedural-generation-algorithms, lore-consistency-checker, modular-content-interface

### USAGE
1. **Initial Setup**: Define core lore, characters, and locations manually.
2. **Modular Generation**: Trigger content generation (e.g., characters, environments) in chunks based on user input (e.g., "Generate a new village near this biome").
3. **Lore Overrides**: Users can edit generated content to align with their vision.
4. **Continuity Checks**: Automatically flag inconsistencies before finalizing content.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Lore-Driven Generation**
> Generated content must respect existing lore, allowing users to override or expand upon it dynamically. This ensures narrative cohesion without rigid constraints.
>[!WARNING]- **Chunked Generation Risk**
> Over-reliance on modular generation could fragment user experience if chunks feel disjointed. Prioritize seamless integration between generated and manually created elements.
