### SUMMARY
Defines height category labels for shallow ocean biome procedural generation.

### DETAILS
This appears to be a list of predefined height categories (`short`, `medium`, `tall`) used to classify underwater terrain or ocean floor elevation in a procedural generation system. These categories likely influence visual or structural variations (e.g., sandbars, coral formations, or depth-based lighting) within a shallow ocean biome.

The values (`short`, `medium`, `tall`) may map to numerical ranges or relative scales (e.g., depth, elevation, or complexity) to guide algorithmic placement or rendering logic.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`short`**: Represents the lowest elevation/depth category in shallow ocean terrain.
- **`medium`**: Intermediate category for moderately deep or moderately complex ocean features.
- **`tall`**: Represents the highest elevation/depth category (e.g., underwater cliffs, tall coral formations).

*(Note: No explicit functions exist in this snippet; these are inferred from context.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone list, likely used internally by a procedural generation engine)

### USAGE
This list is typically consumed by:
1. A procedural generation system to assign terrain properties (e.g., `short` → shallow sand, `tall` → deep trenches).
2. A biome renderer to apply visual effects (e.g., lighting, texture blending) based on height category.
3. A noise-based algorithm to determine feature placement (e.g., coral growth, rock formations).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Role
> These categories are part of a larger system defining ocean biome properties. Ensure alignment with other height/biome definitions (e.g., `land`, `deep_ocean`) to avoid inconsistencies in procedural logic.

>[!WARNING]- Hardcoded Values
> If this list is static, consider making it configurable (e.g., via JSON/YAML) for customization in different game worlds or environments. Hardcoded values may limit flexibility.
