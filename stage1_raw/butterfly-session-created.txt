### SUMMARY
Generates a 3D figure-8 (butterfly) flight pattern for drone simulation with parametric waypoints.

### DETAILS
This script creates a **butterfly session** using a figure-8 trajectory in 3D space, defined by parametric equations for smooth motion. The session includes a center point, horizontal/vertical radii, and height oscillation, producing 50 waypoints for drone navigation. The session stores motion history and building data, with pending fixes for drone movement and replay functionality.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`create_butterfly_session.py`**: Orchestrates session generation with parametric equations.
- **`motion_history.json`**: Logs drone positions during flight.
- **`buildings.json`**: Stores static building data for spatial context.

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation` (local directory), `json` (for file handling), `numpy`/`math` (for parametric calculations).

### USAGE
1. Run in terminal:
   ```bash
   cd simulation && python create_butterfly_session.py
   ```
2. Replay via UI after server restart:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5007`, select session, and load replay.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Pending Fixes**
> Server restart required to apply path corrections for smooth replay.
>[!WARNING]- **Drone Movement**
> Current implementation has minimal drone movement; adjust wait times or simulation duration for full effect.
