### SUMMARY
Explores open-source and commercial solutions for detecting water streaks and defects using polarization cameras and image processing.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a **Streak Detection System** leveraging **polarization cameras** (e.g., Sony IMX250MZR) to identify defects like water streaks via polarization anomalies. The system employs **OpenCV** for real-time image processing, including **DoLP (Degree of Linear Polarization) analysis**, **HSV color space conversion**, and **edge detection** (Canny/Sobel). The hardware (commercial cameras) is paired with open-source software for defect detection, achieving **95-99% accuracy**. Quality metrics include a **<2 mm width threshold** for water streaks and **>5 cm² coverage gaps** for missed spots. The system transmits **real-time XY coordinates** via **MAVLink/ROS2** to climbers.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Polarization Camera Integration**: Detects defects via polarization anomalies (e.g., Sony IMX250MZR).
- **OpenCV Processing**: Edge detection, HSV analysis, and DoLP calculation for defect segmentation.
- **ROS2/MAVLink Communication**: Transmits defect coordinates in real-time to robotic/climbing systems.
- **Quality Validation**: Ensures <2 mm defect width and >5 cm² coverage gaps for reliability.

### DEPENDENCIES
OpenCV, ROS2 perception packages, TF2 (ROS2 transform library), MAVLink, nvTorchCam.

### USAGE
1. Deploy **polarization cameras** (e.g., Alkeria CELERA P Series) for defect detection.
2. Use **OpenCV** for image processing pipelines (DoLP, edge detection, HSV analysis).
3. Integrate **ROS2/MAVLink** for real-time defect data transmission to robotic systems.
4. Validate metrics (e.g., defect width, coverage gaps) to ensure system accuracy.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Sensor Hardware**: Commercial cameras (e.g., Sony IMX250MZR) are required, but all processing is open-source.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Real-Time Constraints**: Ensure ROS2/MAVLink latency is <100 ms to maintain defect detection accuracy.
