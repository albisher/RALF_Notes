### TYPE
architecture

### SUMMARY
Transforms a monolithic codebase into a scalable, box-based object-oriented architecture to improve maintainability, testability, and reusability.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a **Box-Based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refactoring initiative** to address critical issues in a large codebase, such as excessive file sizes (over 500 lines) and lack of separation of concerns. The initiative introduces **self-contained "Box" modules**—small, focused components with clear interfaces—enabling modularity, reusability, and isolated testing. The refactoring targets **9,949-line `app-data.js`** and seven other files exceeding size limits, replacing tightly coupled logic with decoupled services and reusable components.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Box Pattern**: Encapsulates single responsibilities into reusable modules.
- **APIBox**: Generic HTTP client abstraction for data fetching.
- **LoggingBox**: Standardized logging interface for error tracking.
- **DroneService**: Example service class using dependency injection for data processing.
- **DroneMixin**: Example mixin for integrating services into components.

### DEPENDENCIES
`APIBox`, `LoggingBox`, `fetch` (for HTTP requests), external API endpoints.

### USAGE
1. Replace monolithic files with **Box-based services** (e.g., `DroneService`).
2. Use **dependency injection** (e.g., `apiBox`, `loggingBox`) to decouple components.
3. Enforce **Single Responsibility Principle** per Box.
4. Test Boxes in isolation via mock dependencies.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Size Violation**
> Files exceeding 500 lines (e.g., `app-data.js`) are unmaintainable. Refactoring must split logic into smaller, focused Boxes to comply with SOLID principles.
>[!WARNING]- **Testing Challenges**
> Tight coupling in legacy code makes unit testing impossible. Box-based architecture enables **dependency injection** and **mocking** for isolated testing.
