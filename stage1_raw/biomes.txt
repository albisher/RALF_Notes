### SUMMARY
Processes biome definitions stored in text files to populate a biome list for procedural world generation.

### DETAILS
This script appears to be a procedural generation utility that scans a directory (`/Users/amac/Downloads/spq8/Generators/Maps/Biomes/Lists`) for `.txt` files containing biome definitions. Each file likely represents a biome type (e.g., "forest," "desert") with metadata or parameters. The files are read to populate a structured biome list, which would later be used to generate terrain, climate, or environmental conditions in a game world.

The logic involves:
1. **Directory traversal** to locate all `.txt` files in the specified folder.
2. **File parsing** to extract biome names/attributes from each file.
3. **Data aggregation** into a unified biome list for procedural generation systems.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **BiomeListLoader**: Loads and compiles biome definitions from `.txt` files into a structured dataset.
- **FileScanner**: Identifies and enumerates `.txt` files in a given directory path.

### DEPENDENCIES
`os` (Python standard library), `pathlib` (Python standard library), `json` (optional, if parsing structured biome data).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to the directory containing biome `.txt` files.
2. Run the script to populate a biome list in memory or a data structure.
3. Integrate the biome list into procedural generation workflows (e.g., map creation, climate systems).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Directory Path Note
> Ensure the path `/Users/amac/Downloads/spq8/Generators/Maps/Biomes/Lists` is accessible and contains only `.txt` files with biome definitions. Hardcoded paths may need adjustment for cross-platform use.
>[!WARNING]- File Format Assumption
> Assumes each `.txt` file contains biome metadata in a consistent format (e.g., plain text or JSON). Inconsistent formats may cause parsing errors. Validate file contents before execution.
