### SUMMARY
This document captures user interface design preferences for a web-based application, focusing on layout, navigation, and interaction elements.

### DETAILS
This document outlines detailed user preferences for interface design, including layout (single-page vs. multi-page, responsive cards, role-based views), element selection (lore-based browsing, search/filter, visual/text hybrid, auto-preview), map functionality (2D/3D hybrid, zoom levels, multi-view support), and writing/logging features (simple text editor, auto-save, collaboration, templates). Preferences emphasize visual interfaces, multi-information display, and minimalist navigation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **User Role-Based Views**: Dynamic interface adjustments for different user roles/experience levels.
- **Responsive Card System**: Customizable sidebar navigation with draggable/collapsible cards.
- **Multi-Map View Integration**: Hybrid 2D/3D maps with configurable zoom and location selection methods.
- **Collaborative Logging**: Real-time editing with auto-save and version history.
- **Template/Prompt System**: Predefined writing templates for structured content creation.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (purely conceptual/preference-based document).

### USAGE
This document serves as a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for UI/UX design, guiding developers to implement user-centric features. It should be reviewed alongside technical specifications to ensure alignment with user needs.

>[!WARNING]- **Avoid Overcomplication**
> Minimize complexity in navigation and interactions—simplicity reduces frustration and improves adoption.
