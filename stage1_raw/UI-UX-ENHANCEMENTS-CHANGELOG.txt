### SUMMARY
A UI/UX enhancement changelog detailing visual and interactive improvements for a web application, including color schemes, animations, and responsive design updates.

### DETAILS
This changelog documents UI/UX enhancements for a web application, introducing a modern Material Design-inspired color palette, refined visual hierarchy, and improved interactive elements. Key changes include updated gradients, shadows, borders, and contrast for accessibility compliance. Interactive components like buttons, forms, cards, and modals received gradient backgrounds, ripple animations, and hover effects. Generated content sections were restructured for better readability, and new CSS files were introduced for form components, badges, alerts, and progress bars. The design maintains responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
