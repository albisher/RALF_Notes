### SUMMARY
Generates 100+ themed story cards with randomized attributes for testing narrative systems.

### DETAILS
This script automates the creation of 100+ story-related cards (e.g., characters, locations, items) using predefined categories (e.g., `plants`, `buildings`, `dragons`) and combines them with adjectives/nouns. It integrates with a backend API to authenticate, fetch/create a world, and post cards. The script handles authentication, random selection from predefined lists, and error handling for API calls.

The `generateStoryCards()` function iterates through a loop, selecting random card types/subtypes, generating names with adjectives/nouns, and constructing descriptions. It tracks success/failure counts and logs progress.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **login()**: Authenticates with the backend API using provided credentials.
- **getOrCreateWorld()**: Checks for an existing world or creates a new one named "Story World - 100 Cards Test."
- **generateRandomHash(prefix)**: Generates a cryptographic hash for unique identifiers.
- **getRandomElement(array)**: Randomly selects an element from an array.
- **createCard(cardData)**: Posts a card to the backend API with the provided data.
- **generateStoryCards(count)**: Orchestrates the creation of `count` story cards by:
  - Selecting random card types/subtypes.
  - Combining adjectives/nouns to form card names.
  - Constructing descriptions with chapter references.
  - Logging progress and tracking success/failure.

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, crypto

### USAGE
1. Set environment variables (`BACKEND_URL`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`) or use defaults.
2. Run the script to authenticate, create a world, and generate 100+ story cards.
3. Cards are stored in the backend API under the created world.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Authentication Fallback
> If `process.env` credentials fail, the script defaults to `USERNAME = 'a'` and `PASSWORD = 'spq8'`. Ensure these are secure or adjust environment variables.
>[!WARNING]- API Rate Limits
> Frequent API calls may trigger rate limits. Monitor backend logs for errors during execution.
