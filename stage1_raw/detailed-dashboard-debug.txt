### SUMMARY
Automated debugging tool for detailed frontend dashboard analysis using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script automates browser debugging and analysis of a dashboard application, specifically targeting Vue.js-based components. It launches Chrome in a headless mode with custom options, logs user credentials, and performs a series of checks to validate dashboard rendering. The tool captures screenshots, evaluates DOM structure, and logs detailed metrics about Vue components, CSS classes, and text content.

The workflow begins with browser launch, followed by login automation. After successful authentication, it triggers a page evaluation via `page.evaluate()` to extract structured data about the rendered dashboard. The script then logs this data in a human-readable format, including checks for Vue-specific elements, DOM hierarchy, and error conditions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **runDebug()**: Orchestrates the full debugging workflow, from browser launch to dashboard analysis.
- **pageAnalysis**: Evaluates DOM structure and extracts metrics about the rendered dashboard (e.g., main content, Vue components, CSS classes).
- **componentCheck**: (Incomplete snippet) Attempts to identify Vue component markers via `data-v-*` attributes (truncated in provided code).

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Initialize the class: `const debugTool = new DetailedDashboardDebug();`
2. Call `debugTool.runDebug()` to execute the full analysis workflow.
3. Review console logs for detailed metrics and screenshots in `./screenshots/ui-checks/`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses Chrome’s custom executable path (`/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`) and disables security features (`--ignore-certificate-errors`, `--disable-web-security`) for local testing. Avoid running this on production environments without proper security hardening.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The `page.evaluate()` call for `componentCheck` is incomplete (truncated in the snippet). Ensure the full implementation correctly identifies Vue components via `data-v-*` attributes or other markers. Incomplete checks may yield false positives/negatives.
