### SUMMARY
Automates execution of multiple JavaScript session files for a fictional "Space Peral" world creation project.

### DETAILS
This script orchestrates running five predefined JavaScript files (world creation, robots, plants/animals, buildings, and story) in sequence. It uses Node.js's `child_process.execSync` to execute each file, tracks execution time, logs progress, and records results. After completion, it generates a structured JSON summary file detailing success/failure statuses and durations of each session.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **runSpacePeralSessions()**: Orchestrates execution of all session files with progress logging and timing.
- **File existence check**: Verifies all required session files exist before execution.
- **Summary generation**: Creates a detailed JSON report of execution results.

### DEPENDENCIES
`child_process`, `fs`, `path` (Node.js core modules)

### USAGE
1. Place all session files (e.g., `space-peral-session-1-world.js`) in the same directory as this script.
2. Run the script with `node run-space-peral-sessions.js`.
3. Review the console output and generated `space-peral-sessions-summary.json`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes all session files are JavaScript modules in the same directory. Missing files will cause the script to exit with an error.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running in parallel could cause race conditions. The script intentionally waits 5 seconds between sessions to prevent concurrent execution.
