### SUMMARY
Automates UI-based creation of a world session in a web application using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script automates the process of navigating to a web dashboard, locating and interacting with UI elements (buttons and input fields) to create a new world. It uses Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, interact with the UI, and capture screenshots at each step. The script logs actions and errors, ensuring debugging and verification of UI interactions.

The workflow involves:
1. Launching a browser and navigating to the dashboard.
2. Locating and clicking the "Create World" button.
3. Filling input fields for world name and description.
4. Finding and clicking a save/submit button.
5. Verifying the creation of the world (though partial due to truncation in the snippet).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **createWorldSession**: Orchestrates the entire UI automation workflow.
- **takeScreenshot**: Captures full-page screenshots with timestamps for debugging.
- **page.goto**: Navigates to the web application URL with configurable wait times.
- **page.$$ and page.evaluate**: Locates and inspects UI elements dynamically.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer fs path`.
2. Run the script: `node user-session-1-create-world.js`.
3. Ensure the web application is running locally at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the web application is running on `localhost:5173`. Adjust the URL if needed.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer in headless mode with disabled security flags (`--disable-web-security`) may expose the browser to security risks. Use cautiously in production environments.
