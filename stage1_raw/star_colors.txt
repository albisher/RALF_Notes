### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Inspiration Source
> Many names draw from real celestial phenomena (e.g., "Plasma" from ionized gas, "Hydrogen Blue" from hydrogen emission spectra) or rare materials (e.g., "Krypton Green" inspired by Krypton gas or rare minerals).
>[!WARNING]- Context Matters
> Some names (e.g., "Radon Dark") may evoke caution or danger—use appropriately in narratives or design to avoid unintended associations.
