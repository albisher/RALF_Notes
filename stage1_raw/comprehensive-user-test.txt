### SUMMARY
Automated UI and API test suite for a web application using Puppeteer to validate user workflows.

### DETAILS
This script performs a comprehensive user test for a web application (likely a game or creative platform) by:
1. Launching a headless browser with Puppeteer
2. Capturing console logs, network requests, and API interactions
3. Automating a multi-step workflow:
   - Dashboard navigation
   - Creating a new world with name/description
   - Verifying world creation
   - Testing workspace functionality
4. Taking screenshots at each step for debugging
The test focuses on UI interaction and data validation without requiring manual user input.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `comprehensiveUserTest()`: Main async function orchestrating the entire test workflow.
- `takeScreenshot(name)`: Helper function to capture page snapshots with timestamps.
- `page.on('console', ...)`: Listener for browser console messages.
- `page.on('request/response', ...)`: Intercepts and logs API traffic.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
```bash
node comprehensive-user-test.js
```
Run from project directory where screenshots directory is created automatically.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses aggressive Puppeteer launch options (`--disable-web-security`) that may break security in production environments. Use only in controlled test environments.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Network requests are logged but not validated against expected responses. Verify API responses match test expectations for full reliability.
