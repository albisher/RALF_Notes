### SUMMARY
Tracks drone communication, position, and command logs in a simulation environment for real-time debugging and analysis.

### DETAILS
This implementation verifies a user request to log time, position, and commands for all entities in the HMRS simulation view. The system captures bidirectional communication between drones and a master node, records positional updates at high frequency (240 Hz), and logs all commands sent to drones. The backend enhances the simulation engine with logging infrastructure, while the frontend provides a dynamic sidebar displaying these logs with color-coded categorization and real-time refreshes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`spawn_drone()`**: Logs communication establishment (master ↔ drone handshake) with timestamps, drone type, and initial position.
- **`step()`**: Logs position updates (x, y, z) and commands (move_to, hover, follow) with source/target positions, timestamps, and simulation time.
- **`/api/communication`**: Enhanced endpoint to stream all messages (master ↔ drones, drone ↔ drone) and position data via secure JSON serialization.
- **`clean_data_for_json()`**: Backend helper to serialize numpy arrays for JSON compatibility.
- **Communication Logs Sidebar**: Frontend UI for displaying logs with color-coded borders (orange for commands, green for status, blue for establishment).

### DEPENDENCIES
`numpy`, `json` (for serialization), `simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py` (backend core), `frontend/index.html` (frontend UI).

### USAGE
1. **Backend Activation**: Run the modified `hmrs_simulation_live.py` to enable logging.
2. **Frontend Integration**: Load the updated `index.html` in the simulation view.
3. **Logging Triggers**:
   - Drone spawn → Logs establishment messages.
   - Command execution → Logs commands with positions.
   - Position updates → Logs real-time coordinates.
4. **Frontend Interaction**:
   - View logs in the sidebar (collapsible).
   - Clear/refresh logs via UI buttons.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Logs include timestamps in **simulation time** (not wall-clock time) to align with the 240 Hz update rate. Ensure backend and frontend clocks are synchronized for accurate analysis.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> High-frequency logging (240 Hz) may consume significant memory. The log limit is capped at 200 entries to prevent overload. For long simulations, consider throttling or archiving older logs.
