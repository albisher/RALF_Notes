### SUMMARY
Runs enhanced UI tests for a Space Pearl application, logs results, and generates detailed reports.

### DETAILS
This script orchestrates the execution of multiple UI tests (e.g., `enhanced-ui-test.js` and `error-detection-test.js`) for a web application, capturing their outcomes (pass/fail) and metadata like errors, warnings, and performance metrics. It dynamically creates a `screenshots` directory, executes each test file via Node.js, and aggregates results into structured JSON and HTML reports. The script includes error handling for missing files and enforces a 5-minute timeout for test execution.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **runAllEnhancedTests()**: Orchestrates the execution of all predefined tests, logs progress, aggregates results, and generates reports.
- **runTest(testFile)**: Executes a single test script using Node’s `child_process.exec`, captures stdout/stderr, and resolves with test metadata (success/failure, errors, etc.).
- **generateHTMLReport(testResults)**: (Incomplete snippet; assumes a missing function to render results in HTML format.)

### DEPENDENCIES
`child_process`, `fs`, `path` (Node.js core modules).

### USAGE
1. Call `runAllEnhancedTests()` to execute all tests.
2. Results are saved to `comprehensive-test-results.json` and an HTML report (if `generateHTMLReport` is implemented).
3. Logs are printed to console for real-time monitoring.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Timeout Handling
> The script enforces a **5-minute timeout** (`300000ms`) for each test to prevent indefinite hangs, though this may not cover all edge cases (e.g., flaky tests).
>[!WARNING]- Missing Function
> `generateHTMLReport()` is referenced but not fully implemented. Ensure this function is defined to render results in HTML format for visual inspection.
