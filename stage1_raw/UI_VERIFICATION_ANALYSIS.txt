### SUMMARY
UI verification analysis report for a timeline-based application, assessing frontend functionality, backend integration, and UI elements like authentication, stage tabs, and timeline features.

### DETAILS
This report evaluates the UI functionality of a web application (Zephyros Prime) using Puppeteer for automated testing. It covers authentication, URL routing for stage tabs (Generate, Link, Card, Timeline, Story), timeline year markers, and world settings. The analysis includes verified working components (98% confidence) and identified issues (e.g., missing cards in the Card stage, incomplete timeline event rendering). Confidence levels are based on backend API responses, frontend UI rendering, and manual visual inspection.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Authentication**: Validates login page, input fields, and redirection post-login.
- **URL Routing for Stage Tabs**: Confirms URL hash updates for tabs (e.g., `#link`, `#card`) and visual tab highlighting.
- **Timeline Year Markers**: Detects and verifies 11 evenly spaced year markers (20435–20535) and their alignment.
- **Timeline World Settings**: Ensures correct world context (Zephyros Prime, World ID 42) is applied.
- **Generate Stage UI**: Tests input/output layout (columns: input, generated content, controls) and generator dropdown.
- **Cards API Integration**: Confirms backend API returns 2 cards but frontend fails to load them.
- **Timeline Events**: Confirms backend has 3 events but frontend renders only 1 event marker.

### DEPENDENCIES
Puppeteer (for automated UI testing), backend APIs (e.g., `/api/cards/?world_id=42`, timeline events API), and frontend components (e.g., timeline visualization, stage tabs).

### USAGE
To reproduce this analysis:
1. Run Puppeteer tests in headless Chrome on `localhost:5174`.
2. Verify backend APIs (e.g., `/api/cards`) return expected data.
3. Check UI screenshots (`01-login-page.png` to `10-generate-result.png`) for visual consistency.
4. Address issues (e.g., frontend API calls for cards/events) by updating frontend composables or backend triggers.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Backend-Checked Issues**: The Card stage and Timeline events issues are confirmed to exist in the backend (API responses) but are not resolved in the frontend due to missing composables or integration logic. Prioritize frontend composables for `GET /api/cards` and `GET /api/timeline_events` to align with backend data.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Puppeteer Limitations**: Test duration (~30s) may not cover edge cases like slow backend responses or dynamic content loading. Extend tests with additional assertions for error states (e.g., empty cards list, missing events).
