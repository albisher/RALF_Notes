### SUMMARY
Fixes incorrect display of system logs in the "View & Usage Logs" panel, ensuring only user interactions are shown.

### DETAILS
The fix refines the `viewUsageLogs()` computed property to exclude system-generated commands (e.g., `plotly_command`, `cesium_command`) and includes only logs tied to user actions like clicks, zooms, and navigation. The solution enhances filtering by adding `type: 'user_interaction'` and related metadata (e.g., `action`, `object_type`) to distinguish user-triggered events from automated processes. Logging levels (e.g., `INFO` instead of `DEBUG`) and display formatting were also updated for clarity.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`viewUsageLogs()`**: Computed property that filters logs by user interaction criteria.
- **`clearViewUsageLogs()`**: Updated to remove user logs instead of system logs.
- **`simulation/frontend/app-data.js`**: Modified logging to include `type: 'user_interaction'` and action fields.
- **`simulation/frontend/boxes/system-monitoring-box.js`**: Adjusted log types for user-triggered events (e.g., `'view_load'`).

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation/frontend`, `cesium`, `plotly`, `debugger` (for logging levels), `react` (frontend framework).

### USAGE
1. **Trigger Fix**: After deployment, the "View & Usage Logs" panel now displays only user interactions (e.g., clicks, zooms) instead of system commands.
2. **Debugging**: Use the updated logs to verify user actions (e.g., GPS updates, object tracking) without interference from system logs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fix ensures logs are categorized by `type: 'user_interaction'` with action-specific metadata (e.g., `action: 'pan_map'`), improving traceability of user actions over system events.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Overly broad filtering may exclude valid system-triggered logs if not carefully reviewed. Test edge cases (e.g., user-initiated system updates) to avoid unintended data loss.
