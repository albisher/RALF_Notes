### SUMMARY
Tracks maintenance cycles for equipment based on area cleaned, operation time, and mission cycles, generating alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

### DETAILS
The `MaintenanceTrackerBox` class monitors operational metrics (area cleaned, time spent, mission cycles) to determine when maintenance is required. It initializes thresholds for cleaning cycles (m²), time (hours), and mission cycles, then updates tracked metrics via `update_operation_metrics`. The internal `_check_maintenance_needs` method evaluates these metrics against thresholds and populates `maintenance_alerts` with warnings (e.g., "Drive track cleaning needed") if limits are exceeded.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__`**: Configures thresholds (cleaning limit, time limit, cycle limit) and initializes tracking variables (e.g., `total_area_cleaned_m2`, `mission_cycles`).
- **`update_operation_metrics`**: Adds incremental values to tracked metrics (area, time) and increments `mission_cycles` if a full cycle completes.
- **`_check_maintenance_needs`**: Private method that triggers alerts when any threshold (area, time, or cycles) is breached, storing results in `maintenance_alerts`.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy (via `import numpy as np`), datetime (standard library), typing (standard library)

### USAGE
1. Instantiate the tracker with desired thresholds:
   ```python
   tracker = MaintenanceTrackerBox(cleaning_cycle_limit_m2=1000.0, time_limit_hours=200.0)
   ```
2. Update metrics after each operation:
   ```python
   tracker.update_operation_metrics(area_cleaned_m2=500.0, operation_time_hours=5.0, mission_completed=True)
   ```
3. Retrieve alerts:
   ```python
   alerts = tracker.maintenance_alerts  # List of dicts with alert details
   ```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Thresholds are configurable
> Customize `cleaning_cycle_limit_m2`, `time_limit_hours`, or `cycle_limit` during initialization to adapt to equipment-specific needs.
>[!WARNING]- Alerts are cumulative
> Repeated updates may generate duplicate alerts if thresholds are crossed multiple times in a single operation. Consider deduplication logic for production use.
