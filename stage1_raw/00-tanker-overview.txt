### SUMMARY
Provides an overview of a production-ready aerial tanker/logistics system for mid-air resupply and active tether management.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a **heavy-lift logistics platform** designed for mid-wall resupply or active tether management to optimize payload efficiency. It details two primary operational options: **mid-air cartridge swapping** (Option A) and **active tether management** (Option B), referencing external drone technologies. The system is verified with current 2024–2025 open-source alternatives and best practices, ensuring readiness for deployment.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Mission Profile**: Enables mid-air resupply and reduces payload burden by eliminating descent cycles.
- **Option A (Mule)**: Mid-air cartridge swap for efficient payload transfer.
- **Option B (Lifeline)**: Active tether management for dynamic resupply and climbing support.

### DEPENDENCIES
- External drone hardware (e.g., Hongfei HZH-Y150, Bonvaero, SpiderUAV H300) for payload and logistics capabilities.

### USAGE
Refer to linked documents (`01-mule-option.md`, `02-lifeline-option.md`) for implementation details. Validate against referenced drone technologies (links provided) to ensure compatibility with current best practices.
