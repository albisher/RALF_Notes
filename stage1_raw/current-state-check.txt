### SUMMARY
Automated UI state inspection tool using Puppeteer to audit a dashboard’s styling, padding, and Tailwind class adherence.

### DETAILS
This script launches a headless Chrome instance, navigates to a local dashboard (`localhost:8443/dashboard`), and performs a multi-faceted audit:
1. Captures a full-page screenshot of the current UI state.
2. Extracts the `main` element’s classes, padding, and computed styles via `page.evaluate()`.
3. Detects Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `p-6`) and compares them against rendered styles.
4. Flags potential CSS conflicts (e.g., mismatched padding between Tailwind and computed styles).

The script runs in a controlled environment with Puppeteer’s security flags (`--no-sandbox`, etc.) and logs findings to console.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **checkCurrentState()**: Orchestrates the full audit workflow (browser launch, navigation, checks, cleanup).
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript in the rendered page context to inspect DOM properties (e.g., `className`, `getComputedStyle`).
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures a static UI snapshot for visual comparison.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Place the script in a directory with a `ui-checks` subfolder for screenshots.
3. Run: `node current-state-check.js`.
4. Review logs and screenshot (`current-state-styling-issue.png`) for issues.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the dashboard is served on `localhost:8443`. Adjust the URL if needed.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless Chrome may block certain security features (e.g., sandbox). Use `--no-sandbox` cautiously in production.
