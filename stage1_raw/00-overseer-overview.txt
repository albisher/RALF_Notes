### SUMMARY
Provides an overview of the **Overseer** system—a production-ready drone designed for lightweight inspection and safety verification in facility cleaning.

### DETAILS
The **Overseer** is a modular, verified system for inspecting cleaned surfaces (e.g., windows) while actively deterring birds. It integrates a lightweight drone platform with specialized sensors and a bird deterrent mechanism to ensure quality control and safety compliance. The document confirms all components are current with 2024–2025 open-source best practices and references external research on drone benefits in facility management.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Mission Profile**: Lightweight drone following climbers to verify cleaning quality and deter birds.
- **Platform Selection**: Core hardware/software choice for drone autonomy (linked to [01-platform-selection.md]).
- **Inspection Sensor Suite**: Equipment for quality verification (linked to [02-inspection-sensors.md]).
- **Bird Deterrent System**: Active measures to discourage bird interference (linked to [03-bird-deterrent.md]).

### DEPENDENCIES
- External research papers (e.g., Polarsens camera technology, drone benefits in facility management).
- Linked documentation modules (e.g., [01-platform-selection.md], [02-inspection-sensors.md]).

### USAGE
Refer to linked modules for implementation details. The system is production-ready, validated against 2024–2025 standards.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Verification Status**
> All components are verified with current open-source alternatives and best practices, ensuring compliance with 2024–2025 standards.
>[!WARNING]- **Mission Scope**
> The drone’s lightweight design prioritizes inspection accuracy but may be limited by environmental factors (e.g., wind, bird density). Test conditions should account for real-world variability.
