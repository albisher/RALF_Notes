### SUMMARY
Documentation of critical UI and data rendering failures across multiple interactive pages in a drone control system.

### DETAILS
This document outlines comprehensive issues where components fail to render data despite proper registration and data loading, affecting core functionality like drone controls, session analysis, and ML learning. Specific dropdown selections also fail due to mismatched value attributes between code and browser selection tools.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **fetchMLLearningData()**: Missing API call causing empty data display in ML Learning Page.
- **Dropdown selection components** (GPS Mode, Weather Source, Naming Convention): Value mismatch causing UI errors.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (primarily UI component and frontend logic dependencies)

### USAGE
Reviewed for debugging and prioritization of frontend rendering and data flow issues in drone control system pages.

### RELATED

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Root Cause Analysis**: Empty rendering despite console evidence of registration/data loading suggests missing event listeners or conditional rendering logic failing silently.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Dropdown Errors**: Immediate fix required to align `value` attributes with browser selection tool behavior to prevent UI crashes during user interaction.
