The scene’s naive, illustrative style emphasizes a dreamlike, exploratory atmosphere.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Artistic Style**
> The use of colored pencils creates a soft, textured finish, emphasizing a naive or illustrative approach rather than photorealism. This style is often associated with early sci-fi/fantasy visuals or hand-drawn concept art.
>[!WARNING]- **Limited Color Palette**
> The restrained palette (reddish-brown, purple, greenish-grey) may limit versatility for digital adaptations or color grading. Consider expanding the palette for broader artistic flexibility.
