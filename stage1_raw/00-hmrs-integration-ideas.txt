### SUMMARY
Explores integration of autonomous window cleaning robot operational logic into HMRS simulation, focusing on state machines, path planning, and perception enhancements.

### DETAILS
This document outlines integration ideas for autonomous window cleaning robots into the HMRS simulation framework. It details current capabilities of Scout and Overseer drones (LiDAR mapping, obstacle detection, polarization-based quality inspection) and proposes enhancements like a refined **Scan-Plan-Execute-Verify** loop, pattern-based path planning (Z/N-patterns), and edge detection for safety. The document also explores advanced vision systems, such as CNN-based classification for cleaning quality assessment, and sensor fusion improvements.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **EnhancedMissionState**: State machine for structured mission workflows.
- **PathPlannerBox**: Extends path planning with specialized patterns (Z/N-patterns).
- **VisionClassificationBox**: AI model for classifying cleaning quality using CNN.
- **PolarizationCameraBox**: Camera module for streak and missed spot detection.
- **AdvancedLiDARBox**: LiDAR module for obstacle and edge detection.

### DEPENDENCIES
`Enum`, `PolarizationCameraBox`, `AdvancedLiDARBox`, `PathPlannerBox`, `VisionClassificationBox`, `Canny` (edge detection library), `PID` (control library for path maintenance).

### USAGE
To implement these ideas:
1. Replace existing mission states with `EnhancedMissionState` for structured workflows.
2. Integrate `PathPlannerBox` with custom Z/N-pattern logic for dynamic path generation.
3. Enhance Overseer drone with `VisionClassificationBox` for quality assessment.
4. Add edge detection and safety checks using `AdvancedLiDARBox` and ultrasonic simulations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The proposed **Scan-Plan-Execute-Verify** loop ensures modularity—each drone can transition between states dynamically, improving adaptability to environmental changes.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Over-reliance on pattern-based path planning may fail in complex or irregularly shaped buildings; validate patterns in simulation before deployment.
