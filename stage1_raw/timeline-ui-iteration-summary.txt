### SUMMARY
Documentation summarizing UI/UX timeline iteration fixes, bug resolutions, and testing instructions for a Vue.js-based timeline component.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the complete iteration process for fixing UI/UX issues in a timeline component, including layout adjustments, bug fixes, and code refinements. The timeline underwent four iterations: addressing original layout problems (column squishing and spacing), evaluating UI/UX code correctness, resolving new issues (duplicate props), and final validation. Key improvements included better column distribution, type-safe `worldId` handling, and removal of duplicate props. The code was reviewed statically and is now production-ready, with manual testing instructions provided for final verification.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Column Layout Adjustment**: Improved grid distribution (`1.2fr 1.5fr 1.3fr`) and spacing (`24px gap`, `24px 32px padding`) in `workflow.css`.
- **WorldId Type Conversion**: Fixed conversion from `Number` to `String` in `TimelineStage.vue`.
- **Duplicate Props Removal**: Consolidated props definitions in `TimelineStage.vue` (lines 128-152).
- **Manual Testing Guide**: Created structured testing steps for user verification of the timeline UI.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (for component structure), CSS (for styling), Obsidian/Markdown (for documentation), and manual browser testing tools.

### USAGE
1. **Testing**: Access the timeline at `http://localhost:5174/#timeline` and follow the manual testing guide (`docs/manual-testing/timeline-ui-testing-guide.md`).
2. **Reporting**: Document pass/fail results for each test suite (18 tests total).
3. **Approval**: Approve the component once manual testing confirms functionality.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Manual Testing Priority
> Manual testing is preferred over browser automation due to project rules. Follow the provided guide to verify all edge cases and user interactions.
>[!WARNING]- Edge Cases Remaining
> While code correctness is 98% confident, actual browser rendering and user preferences may reveal unanticipated issues. Test thoroughly before deployment.
