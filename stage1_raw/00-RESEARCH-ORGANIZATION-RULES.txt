### SUMMARY
Establishes standardized file and directory naming conventions for research documentation.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a systematic approach to organizing research files, ensuring uniformity in naming, structure, and content quality. It enforces a **numbered prefix system** (e.g., `00-research-methodology.md`) to categorize files hierarchically, with `00-` reserved for overviews, `01-` for primary content, and `90-99` for appendices. Subdirectories must include an `00-overview.md` for clarity, while directory names use kebab-case for readability. The rules also mandate consistent numbering within each level, cross-referencing practices, and status tracking for active/legacy content.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`00-` prefix**: Designates overview, index, or methodology files.
- **`01-99` prefix**: Assigns sequential primary content files.
- **`10-19` prefix**: Marks supplementary or secondary content.
- **`20-29` prefix**: Identifies advanced/specialized topics.
- **`90-99` prefix**: Flags appendices, references, or legacy material.
- **`00-overview.md`**: Required in subdirectories for category navigation.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone standards document).

### USAGE
Adopt this structure for all research files/directories to maintain navigability and coherence. Example:
```
research/
├── 00-RESEARCH-ORGANIZATION-RULES.md
├── 00-research-methodology.md
└── simulations/
    ├── 00-simulators-overview.md
    └── 01-advanced-algorithms.md
```
Follow numbering rules strictly to avoid conflicts.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Zero-Padding Rule**
> Enforcing `00-` to `99-` prefixes ensures sequential, zero-padded numbering (e.g., `01` vs. `1`). Skipping numbers (e.g., `02` → `04`) breaks continuity.

>[!WARNING]- **Subdirectory Overrides**
> If a subdirectory lacks an `00-overview.md`, its parent directory’s overview may mislead users. Always include it.
