### SUMMARY
Structures and organizes drone autonomy test scenarios into modular folders for exploration and production use cases.

### DETAILS
This file documents the completion of a structured scenario organization for drone autonomy testing. The system is divided into two main categories: **exploration** (3 scenarios) and **production** (13 scenarios). Each scenario is housed in its own subfolder, containing core test files (e.g., `.py` scripts) and supporting documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `scenario.md`). The `scenarios/` root includes a `README.md` for prioritization and a `documentation/` subfolder for aggregated results and autonomous exploration notes. Files are grouped logically by functionality (e.g., `visualization/` for tools, `reconnaissance-mapping/` for mapping-focused tests).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`scenarios/README.md`**: Main catalog with prioritization table for scenario selection.
- **`exploration/simple-exploration/simple_exploration_test.py`**: Tests basic waypoint-based exploration logic.
- **`production/01-dji-integration/scenario.md`**: Documentation for DJI drone integration workflows.
- **`documentation/AUTONOMOUS_EXPLORATION_COMPLETE.md`**: Summary of autonomous exploration test outcomes.
- **`reconnaissance-mapping/backend_test.py`**: Backend validation for mapping/reconnaissance scenarios.

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed (assumes Python-based testing tools like `pytest` or custom scripts for execution).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to `scenarios/` to find scenario folders.
2. Run tests via script (e.g., `python exploration/simple-exploration/simple_exploration_test.py`).
3. Review documentation in `documentation/` for aggregated insights.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Modularity Benefit**
> Each scenario folder isolates dependencies, simplifying debugging and parallel execution. Example: `exploration/visualization/` scripts can run independently of production tests.

>[!WARNING]- **Versioning Risk**
> Ensure `scenario.md` files are version-controlled to avoid losing context during updates. Consider adding a `version` tag in `README.md` for each scenario.
