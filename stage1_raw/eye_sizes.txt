### SUMMARY
Classifies eye sizes into predefined categories for stylistic or design reference.

### DETAILS
This file defines a simple categorical system for eye sizes, likely used in design, fashion, or aesthetic applications. The categories (`Miniature`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `Oversized`) represent relative size ranges, potentially for visual or functional comparisons (e.g., in character design, UI mockups, or artistic references).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Categorization**: Assigns eye sizes to standardized labels for consistency.
- **Reference**: Acts as a lookup table for visual or design purposes.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This file is likely intended for:
- Designers or artists to categorize eye sizes in a project.
- Programmers to integrate into a system requiring size classification (e.g., a UI framework or character generator).
- Researchers studying visual proportions or trends.

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Use
> These labels may correspond to specific thresholds (e.g., "Small" could imply a width/height ratio below 1.2x, while "Oversized" exceeds 1.8x). Clarify thresholds if used programmatically.
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity
> Terms like "Medium" or "Large" are subjective; ensure alignment with project-specific definitions to avoid inconsistencies.
