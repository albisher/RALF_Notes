### SUMMARY
Provides an organized overview of hardware addons for a heterogeneous multi-robot system drone project, detailing categories, specifications, and documentation resources.

### DETAILS
This file serves as a central repository for all hardware addons required for the **HMRS (Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System)** drone project. It categorizes addons into six primary groups—**GPS/RTK, LiDAR, Camera, Communication, Sensor, and Flight Controller**—each with dedicated subdirectories containing detailed documentation, integration guides, and specifications. The structure ensures modularity, allowing easy access to technical details, datasheets, and integration examples for each component. The documentation follows a standardized format across all subdirectories, ensuring consistency and usability.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`gps-rtk/00-gps-rtk-overview.md`**: Provides overview and specifications for centimeter-level GPS/RTK addons.
- **`lidar/00-lidar-overview.md`**: Lists LiDAR sensors for 3D mapping and obstacle detection.
- **`camera/00-camera-overview.md`**: Documents camera types (depth, polarization, RGB) for different drones.
- **`communication/00-communication-overview.md`**: Details communication protocols (ROS2/DDS, MAVLink) for inter-drone and ground station links.
- **`sensors/00-sensors-overview.md`**: Covers IMU, force/torque, proximity, and acoustic sensors.
- **`flight-controller/00-flight-controller-overview.md`**: Summarizes flight control systems (PX4, ArduPilot, CUAV) for drones.
- **`00-complete-addons-list.md`**: Compiles a consolidated list of all addons with download links and status.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (internal documentation only; relies on hardware components listed in subdirectories).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to the subdirectory of interest (e.g., `gps-rtk/`).
2. Refer to `00-[category]-overview.md` for high-level summaries.
3. Access `01-[addon-name]-specifications.md` for technical details.
4. Use `02-[addon-name]-integration.md` for setup guides.
5. Check `03-[addon-name]-documentation-links.md` for external resources.
6. Cross-reference `00-complete-addons-list.md` for a full inventory.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Standardized Documentation
> Each subdirectory follows a consistent naming convention (`00-[category]-overview.md`, `01-[addon]-specifications.md`, etc.), ensuring uniformity across all hardware categories.
>[!WARNING]- Hardware Dependency
> Ensure all listed addons are physically available before integration. Some components (e.g., LiDAR, cameras) require specific mounting or calibration procedures. Verify compatibility with the drone’s firmware (e.g., PX4/ArduPilot).
