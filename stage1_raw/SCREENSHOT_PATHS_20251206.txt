### SUMMARY
Documentation of UI test screenshots for verifying a hash-based map generation system in a browser environment.

### DETAILS
This file records screenshots from a UI test session verifying the functionality of a map generation system. The test session, conducted on **2025-12-06**, validates the implementation of a hash-based map generation process, including input handling, progress tracking, and final map preview. The screenshots capture the initial state, progress, completion, and post-generation map display, ensuring all steps align with expected behavior. The test confirms the system’s ability to generate, preview, and list maps with correct dimensions and metadata.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Map Generation UI**: Displays input fields, progress bars, and preview sections for planet map creation.
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time generation status (e.g., "heightmap 30%").
- **Map Preview**: Renders completed maps with dimensions (2000 × 1200) and metadata (e.g., 5 cities).
- **Maps Tab View**: Provides a 2D world map interface with controls and coordinate display.
- **Browser Automation Tool**: Captures screenshots programmatically via browser tools.

### DEPENDENCIES
Browser automation libraries (e.g., Puppeteer, Selenium), screenshot storage tools, and the target application’s UI framework.

### USAGE
To access the stored screenshots:
1. Use the browser automation tool’s screenshot storage location (e.g., `/path/to/screenshot_folder`).
2. Verify the captured screenshots match the test session’s expected states (initial, progress, completion).
3. Cross-check UI elements (e.g., progress bars, map dimensions) against documented functionality.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Screenshots were generated via browser automation and stored in the tool’s default directory. Ensure the tool’s path is accessible for retrieval.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Manual inspection of screenshots may not fully validate dynamic UI elements (e.g., real-time progress updates). Always cross-reference with automated test logs.
