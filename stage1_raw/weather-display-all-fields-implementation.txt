### SUMMARY
Implementation of a comprehensive weather display in a header component, expanding beyond temperature and wind to include precipitation, dust, and visibility.

### DETAILS
This implementation addresses a user request to enhance the weather display in a simulation frontend application. The solution involves two key components:
1. **Header Component (`header-component.js`)** – Updated to dynamically render all weather fields (wind, precipitation, dust, visibility, temperature) with conditional rendering and responsive layout.
2. **Simulated Weather Data (`hmrs_simulation_live.py`)** – Modified to generate fallback weather data with all required fields (e.g., `precipitation`, `dustLevel`, `visibility`) for testing purposes.

The frontend component uses Vue.js directives (`v-if`) to conditionally display fields based on availability, while the backend simulation ensures all data is generated probabilistically.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`header-component.js`**:
  - `v-if` directives for conditional rendering of weather fields (e.g., precipitation, dust).
  - Dynamic styling with icons and color coding for visual clarity.
  - Responsive layout with `flex-wrap` for mobile compatibility.

- **`simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py`**:
  - Generates simulated weather data with `random.uniform`/`random.randint` for realistic values.
  - Returns structured JSON with all required fields (e.g., `precipitation`, `dustLevel`).

### DEPENDENCIES
- Vue.js (for frontend rendering)
- Python (`random` module) for simulated weather data generation
- `jsonify` (for backend API responses)

### USAGE
1. **Frontend**:
   - Replace the existing weather display in `header-component.js` with the updated template.
   - Ensure `masterControls.weather` data is passed from the parent component.

2. **Backend**:
   - Update `hmrs_simulation_live.py` to include all fields in simulated weather responses.
   - Call the endpoint to fetch dynamic weather data.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The `dustLevel` field is scaled by 100 to display as a percentage (e.g., `0.05` becomes `5%`). Ensure backend data matches this expectation.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Conditional rendering (`v-if`) may hide fields if missing. Test edge cases (e.g., `null` or `undefined` values) to avoid UI gaps.
