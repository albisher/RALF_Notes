### SUMMARY
Validates dark mode functionality in a web application using manual checks and automated HTTP requests.

### DETAILS
This script tests a dark mode implementation by:
1. Making an HTTP GET request to a local server (`localhost:8443`) to verify the application loads.
2. Logging expected dark mode behaviors (toggle visibility, persistence, UI state changes).
3. Outlining manual testing steps (e.g., toggling themes via a weather icon, verifying visual transitions).
4. Confirming technical prerequisites (Tailwind CSS dark mode, UI Store state management, and `localStorage` persistence).

The test relies on browser UI inspection and manual interaction to validate visual and functional correctness.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testDarkModeSimple()**: Orchestrates the test by logging statuses, handling errors, and executing manual checks.
- **axios.get()**: Fetches the application’s root endpoint to confirm server accessibility.

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `node:https` (for HTTPS agent bypassing certificate validation).

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a Node.js environment.
2. Ensure the target app (`localhost:8443`) is accessible and dark mode is implemented as described.
3. Manually verify UI changes (e.g., via browser DevTools) after executing the script.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes the app uses Tailwind CSS with `class` strategy for dark mode. If the implementation differs (e.g., `prefers-color-scheme`), adjust expected visuals accordingly.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The `httpsAgent` bypasses SSL certificate validation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`). Use only in development with trusted local servers.
