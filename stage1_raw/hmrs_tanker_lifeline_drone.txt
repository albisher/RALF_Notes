### SUMMARY
Manages a tanker drone for aerial logistics, focusing on tether tension maintenance and power supply.

### DETAILS
This module implements a specialized drone class (`HMRSTankerLifelineDrone`) inheriting from `BaseDrone`, designed for aerial logistics tasks. It integrates components for tether management, path planning, battery efficiency, and collision avoidance. The drone operates as a lifeline system, maintaining continuous tether tension and fluid supply while optimizing power usage and avoiding collisions. The configuration is driven by `TankerLifelineConfig`, with optional research-based defaults.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`HMRSTankerLifelineDrone`**: Core drone class for aerial logistics with tether management.
- **`BaseDrone`**: Base class for drone initialization and core operations.
- **`BuildingMapper`**: Maps drone positions to buildings for navigation.
- **`TetherManagerBox`**: Manages tether tension and dynamics.
- **`PathPlannerBox`**: Handles path optimization for drone movement.
- **`BatteryModel`**: Tracks and optimizes battery efficiency.
- **`PowerOptimizerBox`**: Dynamically adjusts power consumption.
- **`EfficiencyMonitorBox`**: Monitors and reports drone efficiency metrics.
- **`AttentionCollisionAvoidanceBox` (optional)**: Advanced collision avoidance (if imported).

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, PyBullet physics client, custom modules: `.base_drone`, `.building_mapper`, `.battery_model`, `.boxes.*`, `.config.tanker_lifeline_config`

### USAGE
Initialize with drone ID, position, physics client, and optional configurations (e.g., `target_tension`, `building_mapper`). Override default config via `TankerLifelineConfig` or pass `target_tension` directly. Integrates with `BaseDrone` for core drone operations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Tether Management Priority
> Tension control is critical—drone must maintain `target_tension` to avoid catastrophic failure. Override `target_tension` if dynamic adjustments are needed.
>[!WARNING]- Dependency Risk
> If `AttentionCollisionAvoidanceBox` is unavailable (e.g., 2025 import error), collision avoidance falls back to basic logic. Test fallback behavior in simulations.
