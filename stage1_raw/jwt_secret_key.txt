### TYPE
configuration

### SUMMARY
Stores the secret key used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

### DETAILS
This file contains a hardcoded secret key (`b99c19ee02ccc14b1712bb708965fd1d993e27a1e333a9d322c4b839dc0218cd`) intended for JWT signing/verification. The key is typically used in applications requiring authentication via JWTs, where it must be kept secure to prevent unauthorized access or token tampering. This key should be treated as a sensitive credential and should not be exposed in production environments unless properly secured.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **JWT Secret Key Storage**: Stores the cryptographic key used to sign and verify JWT tokens.
- **Security Risk Management**: Acts as a reference for where the secret key is stored, ensuring proper handling and rotation practices.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone configuration)

### USAGE
This key should be:
1. Embedded in a secure configuration system (e.g., environment variables, secrets manager, or encrypted config files).
2. Rotated periodically to mitigate risks from key exposure.
3. Never hardcoded in production code unless absolutely necessary and under strict security controls.

### RELATED
[[None]]

### CALLOUTS
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Hardcoded Key Risk**: Exposing this key directly in source code or configuration files is a security vulnerability. Always use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or environment variables).
> **Key Rotation**: Implement a process to rotate this key regularly to maintain security posture.
>[!INFO]- Best Practice
> **Use Environment Variables**: Store this key in environment variables or a secrets manager, not in plaintext files. Example:
> ```bash
> export JWT_SECRET_KEY="b99c19ee02ccc14b1712bb708965fd1d993e27a1e333a9d322c4b839dc0218cd"
