### SUMMARY
Redesigned the map generation UI to streamline workflows by consolidating map operations into the World tab while simplifying the Maps tab to focus on viewing and future assignments.

### DETAILS
The reorganization consolidates map generation logic into the **World tab**, merging world information and map creation into a single cohesive section. The **Maps tab** is streamlined to display only map viewers and a placeholder for future city/event assignments. Key changes include:
- **WorldStage.vue** now includes a dedicated **Map Generation** section within the Map tab, integrating procedural map generation controls alongside world data.
- **MapsStage.vue** is stripped of generation logic, retaining only a map viewer (`WorldMap2D`) and a placeholder for location assignments.
The redesign improves logical workflow by reducing navigation steps and ensuring map generation aligns with world management.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **WorldStage.vue**: Manages world data and integrated map generation UI with controls (`MapGeneratorForm`, `MapGeneratorControls`).
- **MapGeneratorForm**: Handles procedural map generation inputs and submission logic.
- **MapGeneratorControls**: Manages polling, progress tracking, and export functionality for generated maps.
- **WorldMap2D**: Displays the rendered map in the Maps tab.
- **MapGeneratorSection**: New UI container for procedural map generation in the World tab.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue 3.x, Vuetify 3.x (for UI components), Axios (for API calls to map generation backend), `ui-beta` internal components (`MapGeneratorForm`, `MapGeneratorControls`).

### USAGE
1. **World Tab**:
   - Navigate to the **Map** sub-tab within the World tab.
   - Use the **Map Generation** section to create procedural maps (e.g., via `MapGeneratorForm`).
   - View existing maps via **Current Map Info** or upload custom maps via the **Map Upload Section**.
   - Save generated maps directly to the world state.

2. **Maps Tab**:
   - View saved maps via the `WorldMap2D` component.
   - Use the placeholder section to assign cities/events to locations (future feature).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Integration**
> Ensure `MapGeneratorForm` and `MapGeneratorControls` are properly linked to the backend API endpoints for `handleGenerate`, `fetchResult`, and `startStatusPolling` to avoid broken workflows during testing.
>[!WARNING]- **Future-Proofing**
> The placeholder for city/event assignment in `MapsStage.vue` is a temporary UI. Implement dynamic linking between generated maps and location cards *before* finalizing the Maps tab.
