### SUMMARY
Fixes Vue.js prop shadowing issue where `currentView` data property incorrectly overrode the prop value, preventing the System Monitoring page from rendering.

### DETAILS
The `SystemMonitoringPageComponent` failed to render because its `currentView` prop was shadowed by a data property with the same name. Vue.js treats data properties as higher priority than props, causing the component to ignore the prop value and check against `null` instead. The fix removed the redundant data property, ensuring the prop value is correctly used in conditional rendering (`v-if`).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`SystemMonitoringPageComponent`**: Main component that renders system monitoring panels; relies on `currentView` prop for conditional rendering.
- **`currentView` prop**: Determines which page/view to render; previously shadowed by a data property.
- **`v-if="currentView === 'system-monitoring'"`**: Conditional rendering logic that was broken due to shadowing.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (v3.x), Vue Router (for URL routing), Vuex (if used for state management).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to `/sm/` or trigger the component via sidebar.
2. The component now correctly renders when `currentView` matches `'system-monitoring'`.
3. Requires a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`) to apply changes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Prop Shadowing Pitfall
> Vue.js prioritizes data properties over props when names conflict. Always verify that prop names do not shadow data properties to avoid silent rendering failures.
>[!WARNING]- Hard Refresh Required
> Cache may prevent immediate visual updates. Use a hard refresh to ensure the latest code is loaded.
