### SUMMARY
Fast procedural terrain generation for low-resolution 2D top-view maps, focusing on mountains, continents, and ocean basins.

### DETAILS
This file outlines research into fast procedural algorithms for generating terrain, particularly for low-resolution 2D top-view maps. It employs two primary techniques: the **Diamond-Square algorithm** (a fractal-based method) and **Perlin noise** (smooth gradient noise). The Diamond-Square algorithm recursively subdivides a grid to create height variations, while Perlin noise adds smooth, natural-looking elevation changes. The code includes optimized implementations for deterministic, hash-based terrain generation, ensuring reproducibility. The `generate_continents_fast` function further refines this by combining noise layers to form natural continental landmasses with coastlines.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`diamond_square_fast`**: Generates fractal-based terrain using recursive subdivision and hash-driven displacement.
- **`perlin_terrain_fast`**: Simplified Perlin noise implementation for smooth, natural-looking elevation gradients.
- **`generate_continents_fast`**: Creates continental landmasses by combining Perlin noise and Gaussian-based continent shapes.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, hashlib

### USAGE
1. **For Diamond-Square Terrain**:
   ```python
   terrain = diamond_square_fast("base_seed", size=129, roughness=0.5)
   ```
   - `base_seed`: Deterministic hash for reproducibility.
   - `size`: Grid size (must be a power of 2 + 1).
   - `roughness`: Controls terrain smoothness (0.0–1.0).

2. **For Perlin Noise Terrain**:
   ```python
   terrain = perlin_terrain_fast("base_seed", width=129, height=129, octaves=4)
   ```
   - Adjust `scale` and `octaves` for finer/coarser detail.

3. **For Continents**:
   ```python
   continent_map = generate_continents_fast("base_seed", width=129, height=129)
   ```
   - Uses Perlin noise and Gaussian shapes to define landmasses.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Deterministic Hashing**
> The `base_hash` parameter ensures consistent terrain generation across runs. Use a fixed seed (e.g., `"my_fantasy_planet"`) for reproducible results.
>[!WARNING]- **Resolution Limits**
> Diamond-Square scales as **O(size²)**—for very large grids, consider hybrid approaches (e.g., multi-resolution noise). Perlin noise may struggle with extreme octaves due to memory constraints.
