### SUMMARY
Tests and verifies dark mode background functionality in a web application using Tailwind CSS and Vue.js.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing for dark mode background changes in a local web application running on `localhost:8443`. It logs the application’s successful load and confirms manual steps for verifying dark mode functionality, including background color transitions for the main content, cards, and text. The test relies on manual user interaction via a dark mode toggle button, ensuring visual consistency across UI elements. Technical changes involve Tailwind CSS class modifications in `App.vue` and `main.css`, alongside a frontend restart.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testDarkModeBackground()**: Executes automated checks for dark mode background functionality, logs test progress, and validates expected visual changes.
- **axios.get()**: Fetches the application’s root endpoint to confirm it loads successfully (with HTTPS agent bypass for local testing).

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `node:https` (for HTTPS agent bypass), `tailwindcss` (implicitly via Tailwind classes in `App.vue`/`main.css`).

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a Node.js environment (e.g., `node dark-mode-background-test.js`).
2. Ensure the app is running on `localhost:8443` and accessible via a browser.
3. Follow the manual steps (login, toggle dark mode) to verify visual changes.
4. Check console logs for errors or confirmation of dark mode application.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the frontend container is restarted after CSS changes. Manual steps are required to trigger dark mode toggling.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Disabling SSL verification (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) is only for local testing. Avoid in production environments.
