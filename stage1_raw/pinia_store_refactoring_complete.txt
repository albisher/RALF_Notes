### SUMMARY
Refactored Vue components to use Pinia stores for centralized state management, improving data consistency and reactivity across the application.

### DETAILS
This document details the complete refactoring of Vue components to adopt Pinia stores for shared application state management. The refactoring replaced local state management with centralized Pinia stores, enhancing reactivity and consistency. Key components like `Characters.vue` and `Worlds.vue` were updated to integrate with `useCharactersStore` and `useWorldsStore`, respectively, while maintaining appropriate local state for UI-specific elements like `AppSidebar.vue`. The implementation included comprehensive CRUD operations, search/filtering, and visual enhancements tied to Pinia store actions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`useAuthStore`**: Manages user authentication and token handling.
- **`useUIStore`**: Handles UI state like dark mode, notifications, and modals.
- **`useCharactersStore`**: Manages character data, filtering, and CRUD operations.
- **`useWorldsStore`**: Manages world data, navigation, and CRUD operations.
- **`useElementsStore`**: Manages element data, filtering, and CRUD operations.
- **`Characters.vue`**: Displays character grid with filtering, CRUD, and role-based UI.
- **`Worlds.vue`**: Displays world grid with search, CRUD, and navigation features.
- **`App.vue`**: Central component using multiple Pinia stores for shared state.
- **`Dashboard.vue`**: Aggregates data from multiple Pinia stores for unified UI.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, Composition API, Axios (for API calls), Vuex-compatible Pinia stores.

### USAGE
To use the refactored stores:
1. Import the store (e.g., `useCharactersStore`).
2. Initialize the store instance.
3. Access store state via `computed` or `ref` for reactivity.
4. Execute actions (e.g., `fetchCharacters()`, `createCharacter()`) for data mutations.
5. Handle loading/error states via store properties (`loading`, `error`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Store Integration Pattern
> All components now follow a standardized pattern: import the store, initialize it, use its state in computed properties, and call actions for mutations. This ensures consistency and maintainability.
>[!WARNING]- Avoid Overusing Stores
> While Pinia stores are great for shared data, avoid using them for component-specific UI state (e.g., `AppSidebar`). Local reactivity (e.g., `ref`/`reactive`) is preferred for such cases to maintain performance and scope.
