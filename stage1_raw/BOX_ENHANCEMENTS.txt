### SUMMARY
Enhanced exploration boxes for drones with dynamic paths, random building objects, and learning capabilities.

### DETAILS
This file details enhancements to exploration boxes, introducing varied drone paths (frontier-based and spiral fallback), random building-sized objects (10–50m dimensions), and system learning from simulations. The updates ensure consistent exploration diversity across runs by adjusting voxel sizes, generating random shapes, and implementing adaptive waypoint tracking.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`exploration_enhancement_box.py`**:
  - Adjusts voxel size for building detection (minimum 2m).
  - Implements spiral fallback for path generation when no frontiers are detected.
  - Tracks waypoint count to ensure path diversity.

- **`simple_exploration_test.py`**:
  - Uses a randomized seed (timestamp + process ID) to generate unique objects.
  - Creates building shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders) with randomized dimensions.
  - Reduces frontier detection threshold to 30 points for more attempts.
  - Generates fallback spiral waypoints with ±15° angle offsets.

- **`learning_system.py`** (New):
  - Tracks simulation counts and object distributions.
  - Stores successful paths and knowledge in JSON format.
  - Provides statistics and insights from repeated runs.

### DEPENDENCIES
`numpy`, `os`, `time`, `json` (for random generation, process ID handling, and JSON storage).

### USAGE
1. **Run Exploration**: Execute the enhanced boxes with randomized seeds to generate varied objects and paths.
2. **Path Generation**: Use frontier detection or spiral fallback based on detected boundaries.
3. **Learning Integration**: Feed simulation results into `learning_system.py` to accumulate and analyze data.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Dynamic Path Diversity**
> The spiral fallback ensures consistent path variation even when frontier detection fails, preventing redundant exploration routes.
>[!WARNING]- **Voxel Size Sensitivity**
> Ensure `voxel_size_adj` is set to at least 2m to accurately detect building-sized objects; incorrect values may lead to missed boundaries.
