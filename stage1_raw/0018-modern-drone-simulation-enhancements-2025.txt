### SUMMARY
Explores 2024-2025 drone swarm simulation advancements, focusing on attention-based collision avoidance and control barrier functions for improved real-time safety and trajectory optimization.

### DETAILS
This document details modern enhancements in drone swarm simulation, specifically the **AttentionSwarm Framework**, which integrates attention mechanisms with control barrier functions (CBFs) for collision avoidance. The framework prioritizes nearby obstacles and other drones dynamically, improving real-time navigation and landing accuracy (e.g., 3.2 cm precision on Crazyflie 2.1). Key innovations include inverse-distance-weighted attention scoring, exponential decay for focus intensity, and real-time replanning for dynamic environments. The implementation example (`attention_collision_avoidance_box.py`) demonstrates how to compute attention weights for obstacles and drones, normalizing them to select top-k relevant objects for collision avoidance.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`AttentionCollisionAvoidanceBox`**: Class for real-time collision avoidance using attention mechanisms and CBFs.
  - `__init__`: Initializes attention radius and max objects to focus on.
  - `compute_attention`: Calculates attention weights for obstacles/drones based on proximity, normalizes, and selects top-k objects.

### DEPENDENCIES
`numpy`, `scipy` (for distance calculations and exponential weighting), external drone simulation libraries (e.g., PX4, Gazebo).

### USAGE
1. Integrate `AttentionCollisionAvoidanceBox` into the drone’s control loop.
2. Pass `current_position`, `obstacles`, and `other_drones` to `compute_attention`.
3. Use the weighted attention scores to dynamically adjust collision avoidance policies or trajectory optimization.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Attention Weighting Logic
> The `compute_attention` method uses **exponential decay** (`np.exp(-distance / (radius/3)`) to prioritize closer objects, ensuring higher attention weights for nearer obstacles/drones. This balances responsiveness with computational efficiency.
>[!WARNING]- Scalability Consideration
> The `max_attention_objects` parameter limits focus to top-20 objects. For dense swarms, this may require dynamic threshold adjustments to avoid overloading the system with irrelevant inputs.
