### SUMMARY
Fixes Docker Compose frontend healthcheck failure due to missing `wget` in Alpine-based image.

### DETAILS
The issue occurred because the `nginx:alpine` image lacks the `wget` package, causing healthchecks to fail when attempting to verify the container’s readiness. The fix involved installing `wget` in the `Dockerfile.frontend` and adjusting the healthcheck configuration in `docker-compose.yml` to include a `start_period` delay, allowing the Nginx service to initialize before the health check runs. This ensures the container is marked as healthy once Nginx is operational.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`wget` installation**: Installed via `apk add --no-cache wget` in the `Dockerfile.frontend` to enable healthcheck commands.
- **`healthcheck` configuration**: Modified to include `start_period: 5s` in `docker-compose.yml` to delay verification until Nginx is ready.
- **`test: ["CMD", "wget", "--quiet", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost/"]`**: The healthcheck command that now works due to `wget` availability.

### DEPENDENCIES
`nginx:alpine`, `apk` (Alpine Linux package manager), `docker-compose`

### USAGE
1. Apply the changes to `Dockerfile.frontend` and `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Rebuild and redeploy the frontend container:
   ```bash
   docker compose build frontend
   docker compose up -d frontend
   ```
3. Verify health status:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```
   (Should show `healthy` instead of `unhealthy`.)

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fix ensures proper container monitoring without disrupting functionality. The `start_period` allows time for Nginx to start before health checks begin.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure `wget` is only installed if explicitly needed for health checks. Overhead may apply if unused.
