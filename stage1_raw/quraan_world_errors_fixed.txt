### SUMMARY
Fixed timestamp parsing for historical dates in Quraan World application to handle 3-digit years correctly.

### DETAILS
The `_parse_timestamp` method in `CardWriteBox` previously rejected dates with 3-digit years (e.g., `610-01-01`), causing parsing failures and incorrect database storage. The root cause was an overly strict validation check requiring exactly 4 digits for the year. The fix broadened the validation to accept years with 3 or 4 digits, ensuring compatibility with historical Islamic dates while maintaining support for modern dates.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `_parse_timestamp`: Parses timestamps in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, now correctly handling 3-digit years.
- `CardWriteBox`: Handles card storage logic, now robust against historical date formats.

### DEPENDENCIES
`python-datetime`, backend/boxes/storage (internal module), `card_write_box.py` (modified file).

### USAGE
The fix ensures that dates like `610-01-01` (6th Hijri year) are parsed as `0610-01-01` and stored as proper datetime objects in the database. Modern dates (e.g., `2024-12-25`) continue to work unchanged.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Historical Date Support
> Historical dates with 3-digit years (e.g., `622-07-16`) are now parsed correctly, preserving accuracy in Quraan World’s timeline.
>[!WARNING]- Non-Critical Dependencies
> Redis and Ollama warnings are non-critical; configure environment variables if needed for full functionality.
