### SUMMARY
Automated UI testing script for verifying dashboard and core functionality using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to automate browser interactions and validate UI elements across multiple pages (Dashboard, Worlds, Elements). It captures screenshots at key steps, checks for expected text/buttons, and verifies navigation flows. The test follows a structured sequence: dashboard → worlds navigation → world detail page → edit functionality → elements page, ensuring all critical UI interactions work as intended.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testCompleteFunctionality**: Orchestrates the full automated UI test suite.
- **puppeteer.launch**: Configures and launches a headless browser with security-disabling flags.
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to specified URLs with timeout and wait strategies.
- **page.evaluate()**: Extracts dynamic content (e.g., page title, text) for validation.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures visual proof of UI states at critical junctures.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, local web application (running on `http://localhost:5173`), Node.js runtime.

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run script: `node test-complete-functionality.js`.
3. Ensure target app is deployed at `localhost:5173` before execution.
4. Verify screenshots (`checks/screenshots/`) are generated for debugging.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Security Warning**: The script disables critical security features (`--disable-web-security`) for automated testing. Use only in controlled environments with trusted sources.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Headless Mode**: The browser runs in headless mode (`headless: true`). If debugging is needed, modify the launch config to `headless: false` temporarily.
