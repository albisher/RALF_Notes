### SUMMARY
Codebase organization and cleanup summary documenting moved and consolidated files.

### DETAILS
This document records the complete reorganization of a codebase, including the relocation of scattered `.md` and `.py` files into structured folders. The process involved categorizing documentation into logical directories (e.g., `docs/docker/`, `docs/verification/`), consolidating Python scripts into test, analysis, and session-specific subfolders, and removing redundant or empty directories. New README files were created for newly formed directories to document their contents. The root directory retained only essential entry points like `README.md` and `HMRS_README.md`.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **File Migration**: Consolidated scattered `.md` and `.py` files into organized folders.
- **Directory Creation**: Added new folders like `docs/sessions/`, `scripts/analysis/`, and `tests/verification/`.
- **README Updates**: Created and updated README files for new and existing directories.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (self-contained documentation of organizational changes).

### USAGE
This document serves as a historical record of the codebase’s reorganization. It is useful for future reference, team documentation, or auditing the structure of the project.

### RELATED
[[simulation/research/]], [[scripts/]], [[tests/]]

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Retention
> The root directory retained critical files (`README.md`, `HMRS_README.md`) as main entry points, ensuring no essential components were lost during cleanup.
>[!WARNING]- Empty Directory Removal
> Empty directories (e.g., `simulation/research/`) were intentionally removed to maintain a clean structure, but ensure no critical files were inadvertently deleted.
