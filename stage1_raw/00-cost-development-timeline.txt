### SUMMARY
Compares commercial vs. open-source hardware/software costs for drone development, highlighting cost savings and timeline planning.

### DETAILS
This document evaluates hardware and software expenses for drone systems, contrasting commercial and open-source options. It outlines budget breakdowns for components like drones, LiDAR, cameras, and ground stations, emphasizing cost reductions (51-54%) with open-source alternatives. The timeline details phased development (Months 1-12) for hardware procurement, software integration, field trials, and regulatory approvals. Key considerations include feasibility, resource allocation, and risk mitigation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Cost Comparison**: Evaluates total system costs between commercial and open-source platforms.
- **Timeline Planning**: Defines development phases (e.g., Months 4-6 for ROS2 integration).
- **Open-Source Research**: Identifies open-source tools (e.g., PX4, ROS2) to reduce costs and development time.

### DEPENDENCIES
PX4/ArduPilot, ROS2, QGroundControl, Open-Source LiDAR (Ouster OS1/OS2 or Livox), Open-Source Drone Frameworks

### USAGE
Compare hardware/software costs to justify budget decisions, plan development phases, and explore open-source alternatives for cost efficiency.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Open-source platforms (e.g., PX4, ROS2) eliminate software costs, saving $0-$7,000 annually, while hardware costs drop by ~$50,000.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Verify regulatory compliance (e.g., Part 107 waivers) and hardware feasibility before deployment. Risk factors include resource constraints and timeline delays.
