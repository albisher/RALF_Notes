### SUMMARY
Automated debugging tool for inspecting a local web application's World Assets page after login.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to automate browser interaction with a local web application (running on `localhost:8443`). It logs into the system using predefined test credentials, navigates to the World Assets page, and performs a structured inspection of the rendered HTML elements. The script evaluates asset cards, badges, key features, and checks for raw JSON data within the page content to extract debugging insights.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **DebugWorldAssets.runDebug()**: Orchestrates the entire debugging workflow—browser launch, login, navigation, and page inspection.
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript in the browser context to dynamically query and analyze DOM elements.
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to specified URLs with network idle waits for reliability.
- **page.type()**: Simulates typing into input fields with controlled delays.
- **page.click()**: Simulates button submissions for login.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Google Chrome (local executable path specified).

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`npm install puppeteer`).
2. Run the script directly (`node debug-world-assets.js`).
3. Ensure the target application (`localhost:8443`) is running and accessible.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses Chrome’s local executable path (`/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`) for cross-platform compatibility. Adjust this path if running on a non-Mac system.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid running this in production environments. The `--disable-web-security` flag bypasses security checks and may expose vulnerabilities. Use only in controlled test environments.
