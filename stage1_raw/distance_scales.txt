### SUMMARY
A reference table listing various astronomical and cosmological distance scales and units.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates standard units and scales used in astronomy and cosmology to measure distances across different cosmic regions, from subatomic (Planck Length) to the largest observable structures (Observable Universe). Each entry represents a distinct scale relevant to different scales of space, such as stellar, galactic, or intergalactic distances.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
*(None—this is a reference list of terms rather than executable code or functions.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This list serves as a reference for astronomers, cosmologists, and researchers studying distances in space. It helps in:
- Converting between units (e.g., converting parsecs to light-years).
- Understanding the relative sizes of celestial objects, star systems, galaxies, and cosmic structures.
- Contextualizing observations (e.g., comparing a star’s radius to the Hubble Distance).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Importance
> Each scale corresponds to a specific region of the universe, from subatomic physics (Planck Length) to the largest observable structures (Observable Universe). For example, **parsecs** are standard for measuring distances between stars, while **megaparsecs** are used for galaxy clusters.
>[!WARNING]- Unit Confusion
> Misusing these scales (e.g., applying "light years" to subatomic distances) can lead to incorrect interpretations. Always verify the scale’s applicability to the context (e.g., stellar vs. intergalactic).
