### SUMMARY
Configures and verifies screenshot save paths and naming conventions for UI test automation using Playwright.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the structured directory for saving screenshots of map generation UI tests, ensuring reproducibility via timestamped folder organization (`YYYYMMDD/HHMM/`) while avoiding timestamps in filenames. The system uses a Python script (`take_map_verification_screenshots.py`) to automate browser screenshot capture and relocation to the correct path. Manual methods are also documented for browser-based tools. Screenshots follow a descriptive naming convention (e.g., `planet-map-generated-1.png`) to distinguish test cases, with verification steps to confirm directory integrity and file counts.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `take_map_verification_screenshots.py`: Automates Playwright-driven screenshot capture and directory management.
- `ls -la screenshots/map_generation_ui_tests/YYYYMMDD/HHMM/`: Verifies directory existence and writability.
- `find ... -name "*.png" | wc -l`: Counts saved screenshots for validation.

### DEPENDENCIES
Playwright, Python 3, Bash shell commands.

### USAGE
1. **Automated Method**: Run `python3 scripts/take_map_verification_screenshots.py` to capture screenshots directly to the configured path.
2. **Manual Method**: Use browser tools to save screenshots, then move them to the target directory (e.g., `mv /temp/screenshot.png /path/to/screenshots/YYYYMMDD/HHMM/`).
3. **Verification**: Execute verification commands (`ls`, `find`, `wc`) to confirm screenshots are saved correctly.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Folder Structure Rule**: Timestamps are embedded in the folder path (`YYYYMMDD/HHMM/`) but **not** in filenames to avoid conflicts across runs. Always use descriptive names (e.g., `planet-map-generated-1.png`) to link screenshots to specific test cases.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Manual Overwrite Risk**: If manually moving files, ensure filenames match existing ones in the target directory to avoid accidental overwrites. Use `ls` to check for duplicates before moving.
