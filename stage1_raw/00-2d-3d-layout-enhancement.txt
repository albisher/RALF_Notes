### SUMMARY
Guidance on optimizing 2D/3D visualization modes for drone simulation interfaces, emphasizing multi-viewport layouts and hybrid use cases.

### DETAILS
This document outlines when to prioritize 2D (orthographic) vs. 3D (perspective/isometric) visualization in drone simulation systems, focusing on situational awareness, navigation, obstacle avoidance, and hybrid scenarios. It categorizes use cases by task complexity, spatial requirements, and interface constraints, drawing from CAD patterns and real-time visualization best practices.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **2D Top-Down View**: Provides unobstructed X/Y coordinate tracking and strategic planning.
- **2D Side/Front Views**: Enhances altitude control and vertical obstacle detection.
- **3D Perspective View**: Enables depth perception and immersive spatial understanding.
- **3D Isometric View**: Maintains non-distorting proportions for technical documentation.
- **Hybrid 2D/3D Layouts**: Combines planning (2D) with real-time execution (3D) for complex operations.

### DEPENDENCIES
- CAD software patterns (e.g., orthographic projections)
- Real-time visualization frameworks (e.g., OpenGL/Unity)
- Drone simulation libraries (e.g., PX4, ArduPilot)
- Multi-viewport UI design tools (e.g., Figma, Blender)

### USAGE
To implement this layout:
1. **Select Mode**: Activate 2D for planning/strategic tasks; 3D for obstacle avoidance/precision tasks.
2. **Configure Viewports**: Use isometric 2D for technical docs or 3D perspective for immersive training.
3. **Hybrid Workflows**: Switch between 2D (mission overview) and 3D (real-time flight) dynamically.
4. **Optimize for Interface**: Prioritize 2D for mobile/tablet; 3D for desktop with high-resolution displays.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Cognitive Load Tip**
> Prefer 2D for high-level tasks to reduce mental effort; reserve 3D for critical spatial decisions.
>[!WARNING]- **Performance Warning**
> Overuse of 3D may strain hardware in low-end systems; cache static 2D maps to reduce load.
