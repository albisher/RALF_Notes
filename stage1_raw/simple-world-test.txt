### SUMMARY
Automated test suite for a sci-fi world-building API, verifying authentication, world creation, and element management.

### DETAILS
This script performs a multi-step test of a fictional world-building API, starting with authentication and progressing through world creation, character generation, and element management. It uses Axios to interact with a backend API running on `http://localhost:5173/api`, logging each step’s success or failure. The test verifies:
1. User authentication via `/auth/login`
2. World creation via `/worlds` with provided metadata
3. Character generation via `/characters/generate/hash`
4. Element creation (e.g., plants) within a world via `/worlds/{id}/elements`
5. Listing all elements in the created world

Error handling is included for each step, capturing API responses or network issues.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `simpleWorldTest()`: Orchestrates the full test sequence, logging progress and errors.
- `axios.post()`: Used for API requests (login, world creation, element creation).
- `axios.get()`: Used for fetching data (worlds, elements).

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`npm install axios`).
2. Ensure the API server (`http://localhost:5173/api`) is running.
3. Execute the script (`node simple-world-test.js`).
4. Review console logs for test outcomes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses hardcoded credentials (`username: 'test'`, `password: 'passtest'`) and a fixed seed (`'test_x1_seed'`). For production, replace these with environment variables or secure configurations.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> If the API server crashes or fails to respond, the test will exit early with an error. Ensure the server is stable during execution.
