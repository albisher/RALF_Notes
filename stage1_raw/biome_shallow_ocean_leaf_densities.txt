### SUMMARY
Defines leaf density metrics for shallow ocean biomes, likely used in ecological or environmental modeling.

### DETAILS
This file appears to represent a dataset or configuration for leaf density variations in shallow ocean environments. The term `normal` and `dense` likely categorizes leaf density levels (e.g., baseline vs. high-density scenarios), possibly for modeling plant growth, nutrient cycling, or carbon sequestration in marine ecosystems. The absence of additional metadata suggests this may be a placeholder or a simplified reference for ecological parameters.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **leaf_density_classification**: Assigns leaf density categories (e.g., `normal`, `dense`) to shallow ocean biomes.
- **ecological_model_input**: Provides data inputs for simulations or studies on marine vegetation dynamics.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (likely a standalone reference or configuration file)

### USAGE
This file would typically be referenced in ecological modeling frameworks, environmental science studies, or GIS-based simulations requiring shallow ocean leaf density data. It may be integrated into larger datasets or scripts that define biome-specific parameters.

### RELATED

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Note
> This file likely serves as a **reference table** or **placeholder** for leaf density metrics in shallow marine biomes. If expanded, it may include variables like species-specific density, seasonal variations, or interaction with water depth.
>[!WARNING]- Incomplete Data
> No additional metadata (e.g., units, sources, or validation criteria) is provided, so values should be treated as illustrative or hypothetical unless supplemented with full documentation.
