### SUMMARY
Automated health checks for application components, including API, frontend, and database connectivity.

### DETAILS
This script performs a multi-stage health check for an application using Puppeteer for frontend validation and other libraries for API/database checks. It logs results with statuses (pass/fail/warning) and captures screenshots for documentation. The checks include:
- API endpoint responsiveness (with SSL validation).
- Database connection status.
- Frontend accessibility, title correctness, and navigation elements.
- Console error detection.
- SSL certificate validation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- `runHealthChecks()`: Orchestrates all health checks sequentially.
- `CheckHelper` (from `./utils/check-helper`): Handles individual check logic (e.g., `checkServiceHealth`, `checkPageTitle`, `elementExists`).
- `puppeteer.launch()`: Launches a browser instance for frontend checks.
- `helper.addResult()`: Records check outcomes with statuses and metadata.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, chalk, config (local), utils/check-helper (local), Node.js core modules (e.g., `https`).

### USAGE
1. Require dependencies and initialize `config` (e.g., URLs, timeouts).
2. Call `runHealthChecks()` to execute all checks.
3. Review `helper.addResult()` outputs for pass/fail/warning statuses.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes `config` contains structured data like `urls.health`, `urls.frontend`, and `expected.elements`. Validate config before execution.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Self-signed SSL certificates may cause API checks to fail. Ensure proper certificate validation in production.
