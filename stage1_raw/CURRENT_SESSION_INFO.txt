### SUMMARY
Tracks session setup for map generation UI testing with predefined screenshot naming conventions and automation workflows.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the current session directory for map generation UI testing, detailing how to manually or automatically save screenshots to a structured path. It specifies expected filenames for deterministic yet varied map outputs and provides verification commands to confirm screenshot placement. The workflow includes options for manual file transfer, script-based automation, and Python integration with Playwright.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Directory Creation**: Establishes a timestamped directory for screenshots (`screenshots/map_generation_ui_tests/YYYYMMDD/HHMM/`).
- **Manual Screenshot Handling**: Instructions for moving screenshots from browser tools to the designated directory.
- **Automation Scripts**: Bash and Python scripts to auto-move/re-name recent PNG files and trigger screenshot capture.
- **Verification Commands**: Commands to check directory contents, count screenshots, and list filenames for validation.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Browser MCP tools (for screenshot capture),
- Bash scripting environment,
- Python 3 with `playwright` library,
- `find`/`ls` utilities for directory operations.

### USAGE
1. **Create Directory**: Ensure the session directory exists (e.g., via script or manual creation).
2. **Capture Screenshots**: Use browser tools or automated scripts to generate screenshots.
3. **Save Screenshots**:
   - **Manual**: Move files to the directory using `mv` or copy-paste.
   - **Automated**: Run `move_screenshots_to_path.sh` or `take_map_verification_screenshots.py`.
4. **Validate**: Use verification commands to confirm screenshots are in place with correct filenames.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Filenaming Rules**: Screenshots must follow exact naming conventions (e.g., `planet-map-generated-1.png`) to ensure deterministic verification. Deviations may break analysis.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Manual Errors**: Incorrect file paths or naming during manual transfer can cause lost or mislabeled screenshots. Always verify filenames match expected patterns before proceeding.
