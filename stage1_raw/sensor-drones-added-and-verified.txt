### SUMMARY
Script to programmatically add and verify drones with specialized sensor configurations in a drone simulation system.

### DETAILS
This script automates the addition of five drones with distinct sensor configurations (gyroscope, RGB, IR, thermal, polarization, LiDAR) to a drone simulation system. It fetches the current configuration via an API, updates it with the new drones, saves the configuration, and verifies the changes in both the database (`/app/drone_configurations.json`) and API responses. The implementation ensures all drones meet specified requirements, including mandatory gyroscope inclusion and unique sensor assignments.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`add_sensor_drones.py`**: Orchestrates drone creation, sensor assignment, and API/database updates.
- **`simulation/drone_configurations.json`**: Stores drone configurations post-update (backend container).

### DEPENDENCIES
Python (for script execution), drone simulation API, backend container with `/app/drone_configurations.json`.

### USAGE
1. Execute the script via command line: `python simulation/scripts/add_sensor_drones.py`.
2. Verify results in the browser by navigating to the drone configuration page in the UI.

### RELATED

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Ensure the backend container (`/app/drone_configurations.json`) is running before executing the script to avoid file access errors.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Manual edits to `drone_configurations.json` may invalidate API verification if the script hasn’t been run. Always verify via API first.
