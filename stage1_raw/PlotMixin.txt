### SUMMARY
Coordinates plot initialization and updates via a mixin object, delegating heavy tasks to specialized plot boxes.

### DETAILS
`PlotMixin` is a JavaScript mixin designed to handle plot initialization and update coordination. It encapsulates logic for parallelizing plot setup (e.g., 2D/3D views) and delegates rendering to specialized `Plot3DBox` and `Plot2DBox` components. The mixin ensures plots are initialized only after their underlying containers exist, with error handling for failed operations. It supports a quad-view layout (2D Top/Front/Side + 3D Isometric) via parallel promises.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`initializePlots()`**: Orchestrates the entire plot initialization sequence, validating dependencies before proceeding.
- **`initializeQuadView()`**: Splits initialization into parallel tasks (2D plots + 3D plot) for efficiency.
- **`initialize2DPlot()`**: Creates a single 2D plot with configurable axes (e.g., `x`/`y`/`z`) and title.
- **`plotsInitialized`**: Tracks initialized plot IDs (e.g., `plot-2d`, `plot-3d`) for state management.

### DEPENDENCIES
`Plot3DBox`, `Plot2DBox`, `document`, `Promise.all`, `console.log/error`, `window.loggingBox` (if available).

### USAGE
1. Attach `PlotMixin` to a class/instance (e.g., `this.plotMixin = new PlotMixin()`).
2. Call `initializePlots()` after initializing plot containers (e.g., `Plot3DBox`/`Plot2DBox`).
3. Use `plotsInitialized` to check completion status.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Validation
> The mixin checks `this.plot3DBox`/`this.plot2DBox` existence before initialization to avoid errors.
>[!WARNING]- Element Not Found
> Missing DOM elements (e.g., `plot-2d`) trigger warnings instead of crashing.
>[!INFO]- Parallel Initialization
> `Promise.all` ensures all quad-view plots start concurrently for performance.
