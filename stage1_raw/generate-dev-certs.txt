### SUMMARY
Generates self-signed SSL certificates for local development environments.

### DETAILS
This script automates the creation of a self-signed SSL certificate and private key using OpenSSL, configured for local development (e.g., `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`). It ensures the directory `nginx/ssl` exists before generating the files, which are stored in `cert.pem` (certificate) and `key.pem` (private key). The certificate is valid for 365 days and includes an extended key usage (EKU) for TLS/SSL.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`openssl req`**: Generates a self-signed certificate with specified parameters.
- **`mkdir -p nginx/ssl`**: Creates the directory structure for storing SSL files if it doesn’t exist.

### DEPENDENCIES
OpenSSL, Bash shell.

### USAGE
1. Save the script as `generate-dev-certs.sh`.
2. Run it with `./generate-dev-certs.sh` in the directory containing the `nginx/ssl` folder.
3. Use the generated files (`cert.pem`, `key.pem`) in an Nginx or other web server configuration for HTTPS testing.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Ensure the script is executed in a directory where `nginx/ssl` already exists or the script will fail. The generated files are only valid for local testing (e.g., `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`).
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Self-signed certificates are not trusted by default in browsers. Test locally or configure your system to trust the certificate (e.g., via browser exceptions or OS CA store).
