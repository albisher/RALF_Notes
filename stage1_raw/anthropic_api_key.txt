### SUMMARY
Stores an Anthropic API key for authentication with the Anthropic API service.

### DETAILS
This file holds a sensitive API key required to interact with the Anthropic API, a service used for accessing large language models (LLMs). The key is typically used in application configurations to authenticate requests to the Anthropic API endpoint. The file appears to be a placeholder for the actual API key, which should be securely managed in production environments.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`anthropic_api_key`**: Stores the API key for authentication with Anthropic’s API service.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (plaintext file, no external dependencies)

### USAGE
1. Replace `your-anthropic-api-key-here` with the actual Anthropic API key.
2. Securely store this file in a restricted directory (e.g., `.env` or a secrets manager) to prevent unauthorized access.
3. Integrate the key into application code (e.g., environment variables) when making API requests.

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Never commit this file to version control** (e.g., Git) or expose it publicly. Use environment variables or a secrets manager for production deployments.
> **Example of secure usage**: Load the key via `os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')` in Python or `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Node.js.
