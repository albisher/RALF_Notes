### SUMMARY
Tests and validates Vuetify theme synchronization with dark mode toggling in a Vue.js application.

### DETAILS
This script performs an automated test to verify that Vuetify’s theme dynamically updates when the dark mode toggle is activated. It fetches a local application endpoint, logs test outcomes, and provides manual verification steps. The test confirms that the app bar and Vuetify components transition smoothly between light/dark themes, ensuring consistency with Tailwind’s dark mode.

The script logs technical changes made (e.g., `useTheme()` composable, `watch` for `uiStore.isDarkMode`) and expected visual results (e.g., app bar background change, component theme updates).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`testVuetifyThemeSync()`**: Orchestrates the test by fetching the app, logging fixes, and handling errors.
- **`axios.get()`**: Simulates HTTP request to the local backend (with HTTPS agent bypass for testing).

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `node:https` (for HTTPS agent bypass).

### USAGE
1. Run via Node.js: `node vuetify-theme-test.js`.
2. Manually follow steps in the script to verify dark mode toggling in the frontend app.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The test bypasses SSL certificate validation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) for local testing only. Avoid in production.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure the backend (`localhost:8443`) is running before executing this script. Failing to do so will result in a connection error.
