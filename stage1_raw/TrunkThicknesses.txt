### SUMMARY
Defines a categorical classification system for trunk thickness levels.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates four discrete levels of trunk thickness: **thin**, **medium**, **thick**, and **massive**. These terms likely represent qualitative descriptors for physical measurements, possibly used in botanical, engineering, or environmental studies to categorize trunk sizes without numerical precision.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **TrunkSizeClassification**: Assigns a categorical label to a given trunk thickness (e.g., "thin" for small, "massive" for large).

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
Used as a reference for qualitative comparisons or decision-making in contexts requiring non-numeric trunk size classification (e.g., tree growth studies, structural analysis).

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Use
> These terms may correlate with specific thresholds or empirical observations in a domain-specific study (e.g., forestry, arboriculture). Ensure alignment with domain definitions if reused externally.
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity Risk
> Terms like "massive" or "thick" are subjective; avoid relying on this classification for quantitative analysis without additional metadata or validation.
