### SUMMARY
Research document outlining color schemes and content organization for Space Pearl’s workflow stages, emphasizing psychology, UX best practices, and accessibility.

### DETAILS
This document analyzes color psychology for creative tools, proposing a dark theme with primary blue (#4a9eff) for trust and creativity, while tailoring stage-specific accents (e.g., earth tones for world management, purple for narrative creation). It ensures WCAG-compliant contrast (4.5:1) and recommends visual hierarchy, empty-state guidance, and semantic color coding for content types. Stage-specific layouts (e.g., three-column for generation/links) and interactive elements (e.g., animated links, progress bars) are detailed to enhance usability.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Color Psychology Analysis**: Evaluates themes (e.g., dark for focus, purple for creativity) and their psychological impacts.
- **Stage-Specific Recommendations**: Defines color schemes (e.g., #795548 for world cards) and content hierarchies (e.g., left-center-right layouts).
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensures text contrast meets WCAG AA standards.
- **Universal Design Principles**: Applies inclusive practices (e.g., visual indicators for completeness, semantic colors).

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This document serves as a reference for developers to implement color schemes and UI/UX guidelines across Space Pearl’s workflow stages. Follow the proposed palettes, contrast ratios, and layout structures to maintain consistency and usability.
