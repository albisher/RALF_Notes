### SUMMARY
Lists key reference frames used in physics, astronomy, and relativity for defining spatial and temporal coordinates.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates various **reference frames** essential in theoretical and applied physics, ranging from inertial to relativistic and cosmological contexts. Each frame defines a coordinate system for describing motion, forces, or observations under different physical conditions (e.g., rotating, accelerating, or cosmological expansions). These frames are foundational in fields like general relativity, astrophysics, and quantum mechanics, where spatial and temporal reference must be carefully chosen to match experimental or theoretical scenarios.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Inertial Frame**: Describes motion under constant velocities (Newtonian mechanics).
- **Rotating Frame**: Accounts for centrifugal and Coriolis forces in rotating systems.
- **Accelerated Frame**: Models motion under uniform acceleration (e.g., rocket frames).
- **Rest Frame**: Defines a stationary observer’s perspective (e.g., Earth’s frame).
- **Laboratory Frame**: Practical observer-based frame (e.g., Earth’s surface).
- **Galactic Rest Frame**: Aligns with the Milky Way’s center, used for galactic dynamics.
- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**: Cosmological frame tied to the early universe’s expansion.
- **Comoving Frame**: Tracks structures expanding with the universe (cosmology).
- **Hubble Flow Frame**: Describes large-scale galaxy motions relative to the Hubble expansion.
- **Peculiar Motion Frame**: Accounts for non-uniform motions (e.g., solar system dynamics).
- **Relativistic Frame**: Adapts to special/general relativity (e.g., Lorentz transformations).
- **Quantum Reference**: Context for quantum mechanics (e.g., position/momentum bases).

### DEPENDENCIES
none (theoretical/conceptual; no external libraries required)

### USAGE
These frames are used to:
1. **Model physical systems** (e.g., spacecraft navigation, particle accelerators).
2. **Analyze observations** (e.g., CMB polarization, galaxy redshifts).
3. **Derive relativistic/quantum equations** (e.g., Lorentz transformations, wavefunctions).
4. **Compare theoretical predictions** (e.g., gravitational lensing vs. Earth-fixed frame).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Context-Dependence**
> Each frame’s validity depends on the physical scenario (e.g., inertial frames fail in accelerating systems). Misalignment can lead to incorrect predictions (e.g., time dilation errors in non-inertial frames).
>[!WARNING]- **Frame Choice Matters**
> Arbitrary frame selection can obscure phenomena. For example, using a rotating frame without accounting for Coriolis forces yields incorrect dynamics (e.g., fluid motion). Always justify the frame’s choice in analysis.
