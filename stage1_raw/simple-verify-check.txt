### SUMMARY
Automated UI verification script using Puppeteer to test and capture screenshots of key frontend pages.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a browser in non-headless mode, navigate to multiple frontend pages (main, login, elements, debug), and capture screenshots for each. It logs test progress, handles errors, and generates a report via a helper function. The browser remains open for manual inspection after execution.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **runSimpleVerifyCheck()**: Orchestrates the entire verification workflow, including browser launch, page navigation, screenshot capture, and error handling.
- **CheckHelper.takeScreenshot()**: Captures UI screenshots with metadata (e.g., filename, config context).
- **CheckHelper.addResult()**: Records pass/fail results for each test case.
- **CheckHelper.generateReport()**: Compiles results into a structured report (likely JSON/HTML).

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, chalk, config (local ./config), utils/check-helper (local ./utils/check-helper)

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`npm install puppeteer chalk`).
2. Configure `./config` with frontend URLs and Puppeteer options.
3. Run script directly (`node simple-verify-check.js`) or import `runSimpleVerifyCheck()` in another file.
4. Review browser output and generated report for verification results.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script intentionally keeps the browser open post-execution for manual inspection. Close it manually to avoid lingering processes.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure `config.urls.frontend` resolves to a valid base URL. Incorrect paths may cause navigation errors or failed tests.
