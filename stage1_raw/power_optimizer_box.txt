### SUMMARY
Optimizes power consumption for drones/robots using flight state and battery data.

### DETAILS
The `PowerOptimizerBox` class dynamically adjusts power usage based on flight conditions, battery status, and payload. It applies rules like reducing power when battery is low or during low-efficiency phases (e.g., descent). The optimizer tracks saved power and logs decisions via logging.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__`**: Initializes optimizer with configurable thresholds (e.g., battery capacity, low-battery cutoff).
- **`optimize_power_consumption`**: Computes adjusted power by applying flight-phase-specific optimizations (e.g., 15% reduction for low battery) and returns both the optimized power and metadata about applied changes.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, logging

### USAGE
```python
optimizer = PowerOptimizerBox(battery_capacity_wh=150.0)
current_power, info = optimizer.optimize_power_consumption(
    current_power_watts=50.0,
    battery_charge_percent=25.0,
    flight_phase="descent"
)
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dynamic Adjustment Logic
> The optimizer uses a fixed 15% reduction factor for low-battery cases but could be extended with adaptive thresholds (e.g., dynamic reduction based on velocity/altitude).
>[!WARNING]- Disabled Mode
> If `enable_optimization=False`, all optimizations are bypassed, returning the raw power input unchanged. Ensure this is intentional to avoid unintended power spikes.
