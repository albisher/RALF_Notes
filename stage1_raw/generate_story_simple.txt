### SUMMARY
Script generates a simplified space colony story using an AI backend with modular prompts for structured narrative creation.

### DETAILS
This script automates story generation by interacting with a backend API to:
1. Authenticate and create a virtual world (space colony) with predefined assets (characters, buildings, robots).
2. Break story creation into four logical parts (introduction, character interactions, crisis, conclusion).
3. Use simplified prompts to avoid API timeouts by limiting complexity.
4. Combine generated segments into a cohesive narrative while preserving metadata (world details, elements, model info).

The workflow follows a RESTful API pattern, handling authentication, data retrieval, and conditional generation based on element types.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **create_test_user()**: Authenticates with backend using hardcoded credentials.
- **create_world_with_assets()**: Creates a colony world and populates it with static elements (characters, buildings, robots).
- **generate_simple_story()**: Orchestrates the entire story generation process by:
  - Fetching world and element data
  - Constructing prompts for each narrative segment
  - Combining results into a final story
- **generate_text_part()**: Delegates individual prompt processing to an external AI service via the backend.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, urllib3, ai_service (local module), backend API (http://backend:5000)

### USAGE
1. Execute script to:
   - Create a test user
   - Generate a space colony world
   - Populate it with assets
   - Generate a story using simplified prompts
2. Output includes:
   - World metadata
   - Generated story segments
   - Story structure statistics
   - Model information

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Authentication Note
> Uses hardcoded credentials ('test'/'passtest') for demonstration only. Production should use secure credentials management.
>[!WARNING]- Security Warning
> SSL verification is disabled (`session.verify = False`) for simplicity. In production, implement proper certificate validation.
>[!CAUTION]- Prompt Complexity
> Simplified prompts are intentionally limited to avoid API timeouts. For longer stories, consider incremental generation with smaller chunks.
