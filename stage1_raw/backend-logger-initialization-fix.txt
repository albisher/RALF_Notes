### SUMMARY
Fixes logger initialization order issue in `set_base_gps()` to prevent AttributeError during backend startup.

### DETAILS
The fix addresses a race condition where `set_base_gps()` attempted to access `self.logger` before it was initialized in the `__init__` method. The original code relied on `if self.logger:` which fails if the attribute hasn’t been set yet. The solution replaces this with `hasattr(self, 'logger')` to safely check for attribute existence, ensuring graceful fallback to `print()` output when the logger isn’t available during initialization.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`set_base_gps()`**: Sets GPS coordinates with conditional logging fallback.
- **`LoggingBox`**: Logger class initialized after `set_base_gps()` in `__init__`.

### DEPENDENCIES
`logging` module (implicitly used in `LoggingBox` class), `simulation` package components.

### USAGE
The fix is applied during backend initialization by modifying `simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py`. The method now safely handles cases where the logger isn’t ready, maintaining compatibility with existing code.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Safe Fallback
> The method now uses `hasattr()` to check for `self.logger` existence before accessing it, preventing crashes during initialization.
>[!WARNING]- Debugging Note
> Ensure `LoggingBox` is initialized *after* `set_base_gps()` in `__init__` to avoid redundant checks. The fix is defensive but doesn’t alter initialization order.
