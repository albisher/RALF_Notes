### SUMMARY
Automated UI testing and demo workflow for a web application using Puppeteer to interact with a dashboard and workspace.

### DETAILS
This script automates interactions with a web application (likely a game or simulation platform) by:
1. Launching a headless browser with Puppeteer to simulate user actions.
2. Capturing console logs, network requests (API calls), and responses for debugging.
3. Taking screenshots at key steps to document the workflow.
4. Navigating through the UI to create a world, fill metadata, and verify creation.
5. Interacting with a workspace textarea to input story content.

The workflow follows a structured sequence: dashboard navigation, world creation, verification, workspace access, and content input.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **finalWorkingDemo**: Orchestrates the entire automated demo workflow.
- **takeScreenshot**: Captures a screenshot at specified steps with timestamped filenames.
- **page.on('console')**: Logs browser console messages for debugging.
- **page.on('request')/**page.on('response')**: Monitors and logs API interactions.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`npm install puppeteer fs path`).
2. Run the script (`node final-working-demo.js`).
3. Ensure the target application (`http://localhost:5173`) is running.
4. Modify selectors (e.g., `data-testid`) if the UI structure changes.

### RELATED
[[None]]

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes the target application uses `data-testid` attributes for form inputs (e.g., `world-name-input`). If selectors fail, adjust the XPath queries or debug with browser dev tools.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer in headless mode with `--disable-web-security` may expose the browser to security risks. Use cautiously in production environments. Always validate API endpoints and network requests in a controlled environment.
