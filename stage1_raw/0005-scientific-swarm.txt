### SUMMARY
A scientific simulation of a drone swarm mission with coordinated ground control and sensor integration for building exploration.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a **HMRS (Human-Machine Robotic Swarm) mission** where a **Ground Master Control Station** oversees **4 Worker Drones** flying from a base to a target building. The system integrates **LiDAR, depth cameras, and a ground observer camera** to provide real-time sensor data for mission coordination. The simulation includes structured phases: takeoff, transit, approach, and operating, with a **6-panel visualization dashboard** for monitoring progress.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Ground Master Control Station**: Processes sensor data, generates commands, and tracks mission progress.
- **Worker Drones (4)**: Execute mission tasks, adapt to commands, and track performance metrics.
- **Ground Observer Camera**: Elevates at 2m to observe swarm state and report real-time data.
- **Mission Phases**: Structured takeoff, transit, approach, and operating stages with defined parameters.
- **Sensor Specifications**: LiDAR (100m range, ±3cm accuracy) and depth camera (6m range) for spatial awareness.

### DEPENDENCIES
- **LiDAR sensors** (e.g., Velodyne VLP-16)
- **Depth cameras** (e.g., RealSense D455)
- **Ground-based control software** (for command generation and data processing)
- **3D visualization libraries** (for dashboard rendering)

### USAGE
1. Deploy the **Ground Master Control Station** at the base (0,0,0).
2. Configure drone positions (50m from base) and sensor placements (2m elevation).
3. Run the simulation with predefined mission parameters (e.g., 5m altitude, 10m approach distance).
4. Monitor the **6-panel dashboard** for real-time progress, sensor data, and worker performance.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The **Ground Master** must process sensor data within 2 seconds to maintain mission stability; delays may cause formation drift.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Workers must avoid collisions with the building or each other; adaptive control adjusts for errors but cannot fully prevent catastrophic failures.
