### TYPE
code-script

### SUMMARY
Automates creation of fictional plants and animals in a web-based space-themed application using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to interact with a web application (likely a frontend running on `localhost:5173`) to programmatically create predefined plant and animal entries. It follows a structured workflow:
1. Launches a browser, navigates to the application, and takes screenshots at each step.
2. Identifies and clicks the "Create" button to open a manual entry form.
3. Dynamically fills form fields (name, description) based on predefined data.
4. Submits entries for each predefined plant/animal pair, logging success/failure.

The script handles multi-step interactions (e.g., selecting dropdowns, clicking radio buttons) and includes error handling for robustness.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **createPlantsAndAnimals**: Orchestrates the full workflow of loading the app, navigating to workspace, and creating entries.
- **takeScreenshot**: Captures page snapshots with timestamps for debugging/validation.
- **elements array**: Predefined list of plants/animals with metadata (name, type, description).

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer fs path`.
2. Run script: `node space-peral-session-3-plants-animals.js`.
3. Ensure the target app (`localhost:5173`) is running before execution.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the target app has consistent UI patterns (e.g., "Create" button text, form field placeholders). UI selectors may break if the app’s frontend changes.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer in non-headless mode (`--no-sandbox`) may expose security risks if the environment lacks proper sandboxing. Use with caution in production environments.
