### SUMMARY
Research summary on open-source simulation tools for HMRS (Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System) window cleaning, prioritizing Python-based, high-performance, and accurate simulations.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a research study on open-source simulation tools for developing a multi-robot system (HMRS) for window cleaning. The study emphasizes performance, accuracy, and real-time feedback, with a focus on tools that support Python programming, realistic drone/sensor control, and multi-robot coordination. A key insight is that short, parallel simulation episodes (10-60 seconds each) improve AI learning efficiency and generalization, backed by peer-reviewed research.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **PyBullet (Headless Mode)**: Optimized for speed, minimal overhead, and direct Python control for physics/sensor simulation.
- **ROS2 + Gazebo (Headless Mode)**: Supports ROS2 communication, multirobot coordination, and hardware-in-the-loop testing.

### DEPENDENCIES
- PyBullet, ROS2 (with Gazebo), Python libraries (e.g., for ROS2 integration), scholarly research papers on simulation efficiency.

### USAGE
To use these tools:
1. **PyBullet**: Run in headless mode (`p.DIRECT`) for maximum performance.
2. **ROS2 + Gazebo**: Configure Gazebo in headless mode and integrate with ROS2 for multi-robot coordination.
3. Validate simulations against short, parallel episodes (10-60 seconds) to leverage research-backed efficiency gains.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The research recommends using many short simulation episodes (10-60 seconds) for better AI learning outcomes, as verified by Dreamer papers and ICRA/IROS publications. This approach improves convergence and generalization compared to long simulations.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless mode in PyBullet/Gazebo reduces visual quality but significantly boosts performance. Ensure critical physics/sensor accuracy is maintained despite rendering trade-offs.
