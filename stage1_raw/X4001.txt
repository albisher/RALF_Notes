### SUMMARY
Describes the X4001 agricultural robot, a pre-named Space Peral unit designed for crop cultivation despite planet-specific challenges.

### DETAILS
The X4001 is an agricultural unit from the fictional universe of Space Peral, specifically engineered to cultivate crops despite the planet’s extreme conditions—such as its blue sun and nutrient-deficient soil. It predates the standardized robot naming convention (X-series) and is adapted to handle radiation exposure and nutrient deficiencies through specialized techniques. Its design includes a crab-like structure with multiple legs for mobility on uneven terrain, alongside specialized "crab handy tool hands" for planting and harvesting. The robot’s primary color scheme is green with yellow markings to indicate active plant zones.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Soil Analysis**: Detects and mitigates radiation and nutrient deficiencies in soil.
- **Seed Planting**: Automates seed distribution for crop cultivation.
- **Crop Monitoring**: Tracks growth metrics and environmental conditions.
- **Gravity Adaptation**: Limited effectiveness in low-gravity environments (design flaw).

### DEPENDENCIES
none (self-contained unit)

### USAGE
Deployed in agricultural zones of Space Peral to sustain food supply via automated crop management. Requires integration with soil sensors and growth-tracking systems for optimal performance.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Design Limitation
> The crab-like legs improve mobility but may reduce precision in high-gravity environments, requiring manual adjustments for optimal planting.
>[!WARNING]- Environmental Dependency
> Radiation exposure and nutrient scarcity necessitate advanced filtration and nutrient supplementation systems to maintain functionality.
