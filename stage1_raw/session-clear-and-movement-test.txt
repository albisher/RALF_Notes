### SUMMARY
Test session for clearing sessions, testing drone movement, and verifying motion replay functionality with logging and debugging.

### DETAILS
This document records a test session where the goal was to clear existing sessions, create a new session, spawn a drone, and execute a `move_to` command. The test identified issues with drone movement (remaining stationary) and empty motion history data, requiring debugging of command processing, motion history recording, and translator logging. The test involved logging components (motion pattern, RC translator, ML controller) to diagnose why commands were not translating into drone movement or recording motion data.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`update()` method**: Processes drone movement commands and updates drone state.
- **`command_mode` and `target_position`**: Configuration variables controlling drone movement execution.
- **`motion_history`**: Records drone movement data for replay verification.
- **`move_to` command**: Initiates drone movement to a specified coordinate.
- **Translator Logging**: Debugging logs for motion pattern, RC translator, and ML controller components.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Drone simulation backend, motion pattern box, RC translator box, ML controller box, logging infrastructure.

### USAGE
To reproduce this test:
1. Clear existing sessions.
2. Reset and spawn a drone (e.g., `scout-1`).
3. Execute `move_to` command with a target position (e.g., `[10, 10, 15]`).
4. Verify drone movement and motion history data in logs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The `move_to` command is sent successfully, but the drone remains stationary. Verify if `command_mode` and `target_position` are correctly set in the `update()` method to ensure the drone receives the intended command.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Empty `motion_history` indicates that the motion data is not being recorded during simulation. Check if the `motion_history` update logic is functioning as expected and if the data is being saved when the simulation stops.
