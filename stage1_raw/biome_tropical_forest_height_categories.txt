### SUMMARY
Defines height categories for tropical forest biomes, categorizing vegetation into medium, tall, and gigantic growth levels.

### DETAILS
This file appears to be a simple classification system categorizing tropical forest vegetation by height into three broad tiers: **medium**, **tall**, and **gigantic**. These labels likely correspond to distinct ecological roles, structural dominance, or functional zones within the forest canopy. The categories may be used for ecological studies, biodiversity assessments, or habitat classification in tropical ecosystems.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Height Categorization**: Assigns vegetation growth into predefined height tiers for ecological analysis.
- **Biome Typing**: Supports classification of tropical forest structures into standardized height-based groups.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This file is likely intended for:
- Researchers classifying vegetation height in field studies.
- Ecological modeling or habitat mapping systems.
- Documentation of tropical forest biome characteristics.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Use
> These categories are typically applied in conjunction with other biome attributes (e.g., canopy layering, species composition) to define ecological niches.
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity Check
> Ensure consistency with local or regional definitions—some classifications may include additional subcategories (e.g., "super-gigantic") beyond these three tiers.
