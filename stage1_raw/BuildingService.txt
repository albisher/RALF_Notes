### SUMMARY
Manages building-related business logic via HTTP API communication.

### DETAILS
`BuildingService` is a class-based service implementing **Single Responsibility Principle** to handle all building operations. It uses **APIBox** (an HTTP client) for communication and follows **OOP principles** with dependency injection. The service provides methods to fetch, spawn, save, delete, and retrieve buildings via asynchronous HTTP requests. Error handling is centralized with consistent logging and re-throwing of errors.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`constructor(apiBox)`**: Initializes the service with an injected `APIBox` instance, validating its presence.
- **`getAllBuildings()`**: Asynchronously retrieves a list of all buildings from the API.
- **`spawnRandomBuilding(config)`**: Generates a new building with configurable dimensions, position, and attributes.
- **`saveBuilding(building)`**: Persists a building’s configuration to the backend.
- **`deleteAllBuildings()`**: Removes all buildings from the system.
- **`getBuildingById(buildingId)`**: Fetches a specific building by its ID (not explicitly listed in the snippet but implied by naming conventions).

### DEPENDENCIES
APIBox (`../../boxes/generic/APIBox.js`)

### USAGE
1. Inject an `APIBox` instance into `BuildingService` during construction.
2. Call methods like `getAllBuildings()`, `spawnRandomBuilding()`, or `saveBuilding()` to interact with buildings.
3. Handle errors via `try/catch` blocks, as all methods propagate errors.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dependency Injection
> Mandatory `APIBox` instance must be provided; failure throws an error.
>[!WARNING]- Error Handling
> All methods log errors internally but re-throw them for caller control. Avoid silent failures.
