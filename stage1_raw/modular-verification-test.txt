### SUMMARY
Automated modular UI component verification using Puppeteer to test a local web application's structure, content, and navigation.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a browser, interact with a local web application (running on `localhost:8443`), and perform modular verification tests. It checks for the existence of UI elements (e.g., sidebar, page content), content loading, navigation groups, icons, and functional navigation. Screenshots are saved to a directory for debugging. The test logs console messages, errors, and results in real-time.

The script includes error handling for screenshot failures and page navigation issues. It also logs console messages and page errors for debugging purposes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`init()`**: Creates the directory for screenshots if it doesn’t exist.
- **`takeScreenshot(page, filename)`**: Captures a full-page screenshot and saves it to a specified directory.
- **`testModularComponents()`**: Orchestrates the entire test suite, including:
  - Loading the application and waiting for initialization.
  - Verifying structural elements (e.g., `#sidebar-container`, `#page-content`).
  - Checking content loading via `page.evaluate()`.
  - Validating navigation groups, links, and icons.
  - Testing navigation functionality (e.g., clicking `#elements` link).

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node modular-verification-test.js`.
3. Configure `baseUrl` and `screenshotDir` in the constructor if needed.
4. Extend `testModularComponents()` with additional test cases as required.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses Puppeteer’s `headless: 'new'` mode, which may behave differently than the default `headless: true`. Ensure the target application is running locally on `localhost:8443` before execution.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> If the application fails to load or crashes, the test will terminate early. Always check console logs for errors during execution. Avoid running in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker) unless necessary, as Puppeteer’s `--no-sandbox` flag may not work reliably in restricted contexts.
