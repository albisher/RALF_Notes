### SUMMARY
Generates secure Docker secrets for a multi-service application using OpenSSL and Bash scripting.

### DETAILS
This script automates the creation of secure secrets (passwords and keys) for a Dockerized application environment, including database credentials, application secrets, and API keys. It ensures files are stored with restricted permissions (600) and excludes them from version control via `.gitignore`. The script also generates a validation script to verify the integrity of generated secrets.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **generate_password**: Creates a 32-character alphanumeric password using OpenSSL’s `rand` with base64 encoding.
- **generate_secret_key**: Generates a 64-character hexadecimal secret key for cryptographic purposes.
- **create_secret_file**: Writes content to a file with secure permissions (600) and logs the operation.
- **print_status**: Displays colored output messages for success, errors, warnings, and info.
- **Secrets Validation Script**: Checks if required secret files exist and are readable.

### DEPENDENCIES
`openssl`, `bash`, `.gitignore` (if not pre-existing)

### USAGE
1. Run the script from the project root directory.
2. It will:
   - Generate secure secrets (passwords/keys) for databases, applications, and services.
   - Create `.gitignore` to exclude the `secrets/` directory.
   - Output a validation script (`scripts/validate-secrets.sh`) to verify secrets later.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Secrets are written to files in `secrets/` with **600 permissions**, ensuring only the script owner can read them. Users must manually replace placeholder API keys (e.g., `perplexity_api_key.txt`) with actual credentials.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Never commit or share the generated secrets. The script does not encrypt files; it enforces restrictive permissions. Validate secrets before deployment to avoid misconfigurations.
