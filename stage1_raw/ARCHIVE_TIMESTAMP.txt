### SUMMARY
Records archived Python files for version control and temporal reference.

### DETAILS
This file marks the timestamp of an archive containing three Python scripts (`ai_service.py`, `generate_story.py`, `langchain_service.py`) stored in a nested directory structure (`archived/original/`). The timestamp (`20251113_063036`) indicates when the files were preserved, likely for tracking changes, debugging, or compliance with retention policies.

The archive appears to preserve code related to an AI-driven storytelling or natural language processing system, possibly using the LangChain framework.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`ai_service.py`**: Core logic for AI-driven service interactions.
- **`generate_story.py`**: Handles narrative generation or content creation.
- **`langchain_service.py`**: Manages LangChain-based workflows (e.g., LLM integrations).

### DEPENDENCIES
LangChain (or related NLP libraries), Python standard libraries (e.g., `os`, `json`).

### USAGE
To restore archived files, extract the timestamped directory (`archived/original/`) and replace the current versions of the listed scripts. Useful for auditing, rollback, or compliance checks.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Version Tracking
> The timestamp (`20251113_063036`) should be cross-referenced with deployment logs or CI/CD pipelines to correlate changes with this archive.
>[!WARNING]- Data Loss Risk
> If files are overwritten before recovery, critical logic or dependencies may be lost. Verify backup integrity before restoration.
