### SUMMARY
Creates and updates SQL schema for `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent` models in a database.

### DETAILS
This file is an Alembic migration script that generates SQL commands to add the `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent` tables to a database. The script is structured to handle both the `upgrade` (forward migration) and `downgrade` (reverse migration) operations. Currently, the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions are empty stubs, likely awaiting custom SQL logic to define table structures, constraints, and relationships.

The migration revision ID (`e70966888586`) depends on a previous revision (`7748df999976`), indicating this is part of a sequence of schema changes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **upgrade()**: Executes SQL commands to create the `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent` tables in the database.
- **downgrade()**: Executes SQL commands to roll back the changes made by the `upgrade()` function.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Alembic (`alembic`)
- SQLAlchemy (`sqlalchemy`)

### USAGE
To apply this migration:
1. Run `alembic upgrade head` in the project directory to apply the migration.
2. The script should define table creation logic in the `upgrade()` function (currently empty).
3. For rollback, use `alembic downgrade` to revert changes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script is a template generated by Alembic. Custom SQL logic must be added to `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` to define table structures, columns, constraints, and relationships for `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent`.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure proper dependencies are set (e.g., `depends_on`) if the migration relies on other migrations or database states. Currently, `depends_on` is set to `None`.
