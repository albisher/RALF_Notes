### SUMMARY
Explores LangChain integration into Flask for advanced story generation with temporal/spatial context, chat, and multi-part storytelling.

### DETAILS
This document outlines best practices for integrating LangChain into a Flask backend to enhance story generation, focusing on chat capabilities, memory management, and generative tool integration. The approach leverages LangChain’s modularity to handle temporal and spatial storytelling, multi-part narrative generation, and linking story elements via location and time. Existing backend components (Ollama, JWT, rate limiting) serve as foundational elements for this integration, with recommendations for memory systems, prompt engineering, and error handling.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`LLMChain`**: Core LangChain chain for story generation with configurable prompts.
- **`ConversationBufferMemory`**: Manages chat/story context across API calls.
- **`SequentialChain`**: Orchestrates multi-part story generation sequentially.
- **`PromptTemplate`**: Structures input/output for temporal/spatial context.
- **Flask API Endpoints**: Handles JSON input/output for story generation.

### DEPENDENCIES
flask, langchain, openai (or Ollama via custom wrapper), redis (for rate limiting), conversation-memory (LangChain), prompt-template (LangChain)

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`pip install flask langchain openai`).
2. Define LangChain chains/prompts in a service module.
3. Create Flask routes (e.g., `/api/story/generate`) to invoke chains with user input.
4. Integrate memory modules for context persistence.
5. Use `SequentialChain` for multi-part story generation with temporal/spatial metadata.
6. Apply rate limiting and JWT auth from existing backend.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Context Passing
> Store intermediate story parts and metadata (e.g., location/time) in your database models (`Timeline`, `TimelineEvent`) to enable linking across parts.
>[!WARNING]- Rate Limiting
> Ensure rate limiting is applied at both API and LLM levels to avoid abuse; Redis is recommended for distributed counters.
>[!INFO]- Memory Scaling
> For high-traffic systems, scale memory storage (e.g., Redis) per user session to avoid memory leaks.
>[!Caution]- Temporal Consistency
> Validate temporal logic in prompts to prevent incoherent story arcs; use your existing deterministic world generation for consistency checks.
