### SUMMARY
Automated UI design verification tool using Puppeteer to check frontend structure, styling, and components.

### DETAILS
This script automates UI design verification by launching a browser, logging into a local application, and validating the presence of key frontend components (e.g., layout, sidebar, dashboard) and CSS frameworks (Tailwind/Vuetify). It captures screenshots and evaluates DOM structure via `page.evaluate()`, logging results for debugging. The test runs in a controlled environment with Chrome-specific launch options to bypass sandbox restrictions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`runTest()`**: Orchestrates the full test workflow: browser launch, login, UI verification, and screenshot capture.
- **`page.evaluate()`**: Executes JavaScript in the rendered page to inspect DOM elements and CSS presence dynamically.
- **`page.goto()`**: Navigates to the target URL with network idle wait.
- **`page.type()`/`page.click()`**: Simulates user interactions (login).
- **`page.screenshot()`**: Captures full-page screenshots for verification.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Chrome browser (bundled via `executablePath`)

### USAGE
1. Initialize the class: `const verifier = new MasterDesignVerification()`.
2. Call `verifier.runTest()` to execute the full verification pipeline.
3. Review console logs for component presence and screenshot paths.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses Chrome’s `--disable-web-security` flag, which may expose the app to XSS risks in production. Use only in sandboxed environments.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Hardcoded credentials (`test/testpass`) are insecure. Replace with environment variables or a secure credential manager.
