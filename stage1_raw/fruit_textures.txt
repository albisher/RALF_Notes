### SUMMARY
A categorized list of common fruit texture descriptors for procedural or asset-based texture generation in games.

### DETAILS
This file defines a set of texture descriptors (`Smooth`, `Rough`, `Spiky`, etc.) used to classify or generate realistic fruit appearances. Each descriptor represents a distinct material property, influencing visual or procedural texture generation workflows (e.g., in game engines or asset pipelines). The list is likely referenced in code for dynamic texture assignment, material shaders, or procedural generation algorithms.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
*(None—this is a static data file.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
None (plain text/listing; may integrate with libraries like `shadertoy` or `Unity’s Material Properties` for dynamic use).

### USAGE
1. **Static Reference**: Embed these descriptors in scripts (e.g., JSON/YAML) for texture lookup tables or material presets.
2. **Procedural Generation**: Use as input for noise-based texture algorithms (e.g., Perlin noise + roughness modifiers).
3. **Game Art Pipeline**: Assign textures dynamically via a lookup system (e.g., `if (fruitTexture == "Spiky") { ... }`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dynamic Integration
> These descriptors should be paired with a **texture sampling system** (e.g., UV mapping or procedural noise) to avoid hardcoded static images. Example:
> ```python
> roughness = descriptors["Rough"]  # Assigns a noise scale factor.
> ```
>[!WARNING]- Overlap Risk
> Terms like "Spiky" and "Fuzzy" may overlap—ensure distinct visual/algorithmic definitions to avoid blending artifacts in generated textures.
