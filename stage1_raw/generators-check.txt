### SUMMARY
Automated UI validation for a Generators UI section using Puppeteer and helper functions.

### DETAILS
This script performs automated UI checks for a Generators section in a web application. It uses Puppeteer to launch a browser, navigate to specified pages, and verify the presence of key UI elements (e.g., dashboard generators section, generate buttons, input fields). The script captures screenshots and logs results via a `CheckHelper` utility, categorizing findings as pass, warning, or fail based on element detection.

The workflow involves:
1. Launching a browser instance with Puppeteer.
2. Navigating to the frontend dashboard and elements page.
3. Evaluating DOM content for text/element matches (e.g., "generator," "generate").
4. Capturing screenshots and logging results with status codes.
5. Handling errors gracefully with detailed failure messages.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **runGeneratorsChecks**: Orchestrates the entire UI validation process.
- **CheckHelper**: Manages result logging, screenshot capture, and status tracking.
- **page.goto**: Navigates to frontend URLs with configurable wait times.
- **page.evaluate**: Executes JavaScript in the browser context to check DOM elements.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, chalk, config (local), utils/check-helper (local)

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`puppeteer`, `chalk`).
2. Configure `config` file with Puppeteer launch settings, URLs, and timeouts.
3. Run script: `node generators-check.js`.
4. Results are logged via `CheckHelper` (pass/warning/fail) and stored as screenshots.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `page.evaluate()` for DOM checks, which may fail if the frontend dynamically loads content after initial render. Consider adding explicit waits (e.g., `page.waitForSelector()`) for dynamic elements.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Screenshot paths (`relativePath`) are derived from `helper.takeScreenshot()`, but the script does not validate if screenshots were saved successfully. Add a post-check to verify file existence if critical.
