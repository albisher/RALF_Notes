### TYPE
data-configuration

### SUMMARY
Defines light-level configurations for volcanic biomes, including sunlight and geothermal/IR influences.

### DETAILS
This file appears to define environmental light-level parameters for volcanic biomes, likely used in a game or simulation to model how volcanic activity affects lighting. The data includes:
- **Bright Sunlight**: Likely a baseline or primary light source.
- **Geothermal**: Represents heat and light emitted from volcanic activity, contributing to ambient lighting.
- **Infrared Spectrum**: Describes how volcanic heat influences infrared radiation, affecting visibility or perception in the environment.

The values may be used to dynamically adjust lighting effects (e.g., glow, glowmaps, or visibility thresholds) in a game or procedural generation system.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Lighting Override**: Applies volcanic-specific light adjustments (e.g., glow intensity, spectral shifts).
- **Environmental Simulation**: Modifies lighting based on geothermal/IR emissions for volcanic terrain.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone data configuration)

### USAGE
This file would typically be loaded as a data table or JSON/YAML configuration in a game engine or simulation framework. Example usage:
```plaintext
// In a game's lighting system:
load_light_config("biome_volcanic_light_levels");
apply_volcanic_light_effects();
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Use
> This file is likely part of a larger biome system where volcanic terrain requires dynamic lighting adjustments (e.g., lava glow, thermal radiation effects). Ensure compatibility with the game’s lighting API.
>[!WARNING]- Data Interpretation
> Values for "Geothermal" and "Infrared Spectrum" may require calibration—excessive values could cause visual artifacts (e.g., overbrightness or unrealistic heat effects). Test in-game with realistic volcanic scenarios.
