### SUMMARY
Validates sensor performance, drone navigation, and spatial object detection in a 3D simulation environment.

### DETAILS
This file documents a successful sensor simulation test where a drone navigates through a predefined 3D space, interacting with hidden random objects. The test validates LiDAR sensor accuracy, position tracking, and base station telemetry reception. Key metrics include LiDAR point capture, range accuracy, and spatial bounds discovery, with all systems operating without failure.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Ground Truth Log**: Records object spawn positions for validation.
- **LiDAR Sensor Validation**: Tests ray casting, noise handling, and point accuracy.
- **Drone Mission Execution**: Evaluates waypoint navigation and telemetry reception.
- **Base Station Processing**: Confirms telemetry packet handling and spatial bounds calculation.

### DEPENDENCIES
`ground_truth_log.json`, `base_station_log.json`, LiDAR sensor SDK, drone autopilot module, physics engine (for object simulation).

### USAGE
To reproduce this test:
1. Deploy a drone at the base location (0.0, 0.0, 5.0).
2. Spawn 5 random 3D objects in a 15-45m² area.
3. Execute a 6-waypoint mission, returning to base.
4. Validate logs (`ground_truth_log.json` and `base_station_log.json`) for accuracy.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The test ensures objects are spawned in a physics engine but remain hidden from the command & control system, requiring LiDAR to detect them. Logs (`ground_truth_log.json`) confirm object positions match sensor readings.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Gaussian noise (±3cm) is applied to LiDAR readings to simulate real-world inaccuracies. Overly strict accuracy thresholds may fail validation in noisy environments.
