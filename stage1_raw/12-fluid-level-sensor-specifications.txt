### SUMMARY
Document outlines specifications for fluid level sensors, focusing on types, principles, and applications for drone-based tank monitoring.

### DETAILS
This document provides detailed specifications for four types of fluid level sensors: ultrasonic, capacitive, float, and pressure/submersible sensors. Each sensor type is analyzed for its operational principle, advantages, disadvantages, and technical parameters such as range, accuracy, update rate, temperature tolerance, and power consumption. The content is tailored for applications in drone-operated tankers, emphasizing reliability for cleaning fluid monitoring.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Ultrasonic Level Sensors**: Non-contact liquid level detection via ultrasonic wave echo measurement.
- **Capacitive Level Sensors**: Capacitance-based detection of liquid presence around a probe.
- **Float Level Sensors**: Mechanical float movement triggering switches or continuous signals for level detection.
- **Pressure/Submersible Level Sensors**: Hydrostatic pressure measurement at the tank bottom to infer liquid level.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone specifications document referencing external sources).

### USAGE
This document serves as a reference for selecting and configuring fluid level sensors for drone applications, particularly in tanker systems requiring precise liquid level monitoring.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Drone-Specific Considerations**
> Ensure sensor selection accounts for environmental factors like temperature fluctuations and potential foam interference, which can affect ultrasonic sensors.
>[!WARNING]- **Mechanical Wear Risk**
> Float sensors may degrade over time due to moving parts, requiring regular maintenance for long-term reliability in harsh conditions.
