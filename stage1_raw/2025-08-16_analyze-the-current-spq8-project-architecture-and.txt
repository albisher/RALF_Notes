### SUMMARY
Analyzes the SPQ8 project architecture, focusing on the roles of the Nginx proxy and Redis cache containers, their necessity, and potential simplification.

### DETAILS
The SPQ8 project employs a containerized microservices architecture with **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and load balancer, handling SSL termination, request routing, and static content delivery. **Redis** acts as an in-memory cache for session management, data persistence, and performance optimization. Both components are critical for scalability, security, and efficiency in asset creation and UI automation workflows. Their necessity depends on current usage patterns—simplification may be viable only if traffic and caching demands are minimal.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Nginx Proxy Container**: Routes HTTP traffic, terminates SSL, balances load, and serves static assets.
- **Redis Cache Container**: Stores transient data, caches queries, and manages sessions to reduce backend load.
- **Reverse Proxy Abstraction**: Isolates backend services from direct external access.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces latency via caching and session management.

### DEPENDENCIES
nginx (reverse proxy), Redis (in-memory cache), Docker (container orchestration), HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

### USAGE
- **Nginx**: Deployed as the front-facing entry point; requires backend service integration via `location` directives.
- **Redis**: Configured for caching/session storage; must be integrated with application code (e.g., via Redis client libraries).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Role of Nginx
> Nginx is essential for secure, scalable request routing. Removing it risks direct backend exposure and security vulnerabilities.
>[!WARNING]- Cache Dependency Warning
> Redis is critical for performance in asset-heavy workflows. Disabling it may degrade responsiveness or cause session failures.
