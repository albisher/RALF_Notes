### SUMMARY
Analyzes how seed variations in a procedural map generator ensure deterministic yet distinct map outputs by altering core components like Voronoi cell structures and heightmaps.

### DETAILS
This document examines the impact of seed changes on a multi-stage procedural map generation system. The analysis reveals that seeds influence foundational components—Voronoi cell positioning and heightmap generation—which collectively produce entirely new map layouts. While city placement and biome assignment are indirectly affected, their deterministic nature ensures consistent outcomes when terrain varies. The system employs a consistent hashing method (`md5` truncation) to derive random seeds, ensuring reproducibility across components while maintaining independence between them.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **VoronoiGenerator**: Randomizes cell positions via a hashed seed, creating unique map topology.
- **HeightmapGenerator**: Uses a seed-suffix to randomize terrain heights, affecting land/water distribution.
- **CityPlacer**: Relies on terrain suitability (derived from heightmap) for deterministic city placement.
- **BiomeCalculator**: Deterministically assigns biomes based on height values, changing with seed-derived heightmaps.
- **Seed Hashing Logic**: Converts seeds into 32-bit integers via MD5 truncation for consistent randomness.

### DEPENDENCIES
`numpy`, `hashlib`, `random`, procedural-generation libraries (e.g., `scipy.spatial.Voronoi`), custom map-engine modules (`VoronoiGenerator`, `HeightmapGenerator`, `CityPlacer`).

### USAGE
To verify seed impact:
1. Generate maps with identical seeds (e.g., "test123") to confirm reproducibility.
2. Compare maps with different seeds (e.g., "test123" vs "test456") to ensure distinct outputs.
3. Validate that biomes and cities adapt to terrain changes (e.g., via heightmap variations).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Dependency**
>VoronoiGenerator’s random seed generation (`np.random.seed`) directly influences map topology. A seed collision (e.g., two identical seeds producing the same hash) would render maps identical, despite different inputs.
>[!WARNING]- **Hash Collision Mitigation**
>While MD5 truncation (32-bit) reduces collision risk, longer seeds or alternative hashing (e.g., SHA-256) could further minimize probability. Test edge cases with extreme seeds (e.g., "00000000" vs "ffffffff").
