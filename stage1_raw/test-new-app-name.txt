### SUMMARY
Automated UI verification script for a local web application using Puppeteer to test app name rendering and language switching.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, navigate to a local Vue.js/Vite application (running on `localhost:5173`), and verify:
- The rendered page title and app bar title (in the current language, Arabic in this case: "ملاحم").
- The presence of a subtitle element (using multiple selectors as fallback).
- Language switching functionality (clicking an Arabic/English button and verifying title updates).
The script captures screenshots of both the original and language-switched views, then returns structured results or errors.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testNewAppName()**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow (browser launch, UI checks, language switch, cleanup).
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to the local app URL with timeout and idle-network checks.
- **page.evaluate()**: Extracts text from DOM elements (title/subtitle) via CSS selectors.
- **page.screenshot()**: Captures full-page screenshots for debugging.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, node.js

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node test-new-app-name.js`.
3. Ensure the app is running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.
4. The script logs results to console and saves screenshots in a `screenshots/` folder.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the app uses Vuetify (due to selectors like `.v-toolbar-title`). If the UI differs, adjust selectors accordingly.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless mode (`--no-sandbox`) may not work on all systems. Test in a controlled environment with proper permissions.
