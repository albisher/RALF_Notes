### SUMMARY
A checklist for manual verification of all delete operations in the Space Pearl World Builder application to prevent accidental data loss.

### DETAILS
This checklist is designed to ensure thorough manual testing of delete functionality across multiple modules in the Space Pearl World Builder. While automated tests handle add/edit operations, delete operations require human oversight to confirm correct behavior, confirmation prompts, and data integrity. The document outlines specific pages (`/lore-setup`, `/elements`, `/characters`, etc.) and their respective delete operations, including UI patterns for delete buttons, confirmation dialogs, and disabled/enabled states. Each task involves navigating to a section, identifying a deletable item, triggering the delete action, and verifying the item’s removal.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Manual Delete Verification**: Ensures all delete operations are tested manually for correctness and safety.
- **UI Pattern Validation**: Checks consistency in delete button locations (e.g., trash can icon, X button) and confirmation dialogs.
- **Data Integrity Confirmation**: Verifies items are removed from lists after deletion.
- **Error State Handling**: Tests disabled/enabled/delete buttons and loading states.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Space Pearl World Builder application UI components (e.g., `/lore-setup`, `/elements`).
- Manual testing tools (e.g., screenshots, logging).
- No external libraries—primarily a documentation checklist.

### USAGE
1. **Assign to Testers**: Distribute this checklist to users responsible for manual testing.
2. **Prioritize High-Risk Items**: Focus on critical sections (e.g., `/worlds`, `/characters`) first.
3. **Document Issues**: Note any failures (e.g., missing confirmation dialogs) and report them.
4. **Re-test After Fixes**: Verify fixes for reported issues before marking tasks complete.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Safety First**: Always confirm manual deletions via a visible dialog (e.g., "Are you sure?"). Avoid direct deletions without confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Backup Critical Data**: Before testing deletions in `/worlds` or `/characters`, ensure backups exist. Some deletions may be irreversible.
