### SUMMARY
Hardcoded password for OpenProject PostgreSQL database authentication.

### DETAILS
This file contains a hardcoded password used for PostgreSQL authentication in an OpenProject deployment. The password is stored in plaintext and is likely used for database connection credentials, specifically for the OpenProject database service. This is a security risk if exposed improperly, as it could allow unauthorized access to the database.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Database Authentication**: Used to secure PostgreSQL connections for OpenProject.
  *(No explicit functions—this is a static credential file.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
postgresql (database engine), OpenProject (application framework)

### USAGE
This password should be securely stored in the OpenProject configuration (e.g., `.env` file or `postgresql.conf`) and not exposed in plaintext files. In production, use environment variables or secrets management systems instead.

### CALLOUTS
>[!WARNING]- Security Risk
> Exposing this password in plaintext files compromises database security. Always use encrypted secrets management (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) or environment variables.
>[!WARNING]- Version-Specific Risk
> If this file is part of an older OpenProject version, ensure the password is updated if credentials change during migrations.
