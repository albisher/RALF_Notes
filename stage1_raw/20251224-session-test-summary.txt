### SUMMARY
Document summarizes session test results, fixes, and expected behavior for a system monitoring page in a simulation application.

### DETAILS
This document records test execution for a system monitoring page in a simulation application, including successful container restarts, session creation, simulation execution, and modal interactions. It also details issues with hash-based routing and navigation synchronization, which were fixed by enhancing URL routing logic and updating app data handling. The fixes ensure proper display and functionality of the monitoring page after browser refresh.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`URLRoutingBox`**: Manages hash-based routing for URL navigation.
- **`handleViewChange()`**: Updates view state and URL synchronization.
- **`initializeFromURL()`**: Parses and initializes the app state from the URL.
- **`navigateToView()`**: Updates the URL and view state during navigation.
- **`handlePopState()`**: Handles state changes triggered by URL changes.
- **`handleHashChange()`**: Processes hash-based URL changes.
- **`syncWithGlobalMonitoring()`**: Synchronizes monitoring data with the session.

### DEPENDENCIES
`docker-compose`, `simulation/frontend/boxes/url-routing-box.js`, `simulation/frontend/app-data.js`

### USAGE
To use the fixed system monitoring page:
1. Navigate to the page via sidebar or direct URL (`#/sm/`).
2. Refresh the browser to apply changes.
3. Verify session information and monitoring data display.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The fixes ensure that the system monitoring page now correctly displays session details (ID, current view, last update, and status) after resolving hash-based routing and URL synchronization issues.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Users must refresh the browser after applying fixes to ensure the updated routing and navigation logic takes effect.
