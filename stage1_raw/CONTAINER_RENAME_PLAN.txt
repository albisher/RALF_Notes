### **SUMMARY**
Documentation outlining the renaming of a container from `quadcopter-simulator` to `hmrs-simulator` to reflect broader drone support.

### **DETAILS**
This plan details the rationale and steps for renaming the container from `quadcopter-simulator` to `hmrs-simulator` to accurately reflect the HMRS (Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System) framework, which supports multiple drone types beyond quadcopters. The original name was misleading, as the system supports octocopters, hexacopters, fixed-wing, helicopters, and other drone variants. The update includes renaming the container, updating documentation, scripts, and references across multiple files to ensure consistency.

### **KEY_FUNCTIONS**
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines container names and services.
- **`HMRS_SIMULATOR_TASKS.md`**: Documentation file for simulation tasks (renamed from `QUADCOPTER_SIMULATOR_TASKS.md`).
- **`run_live.sh`**: Script that launches or manages the simulation container.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation with references to the container name.

### **DEPENDENCIES**
None (primarily involves file renaming and documentation updates).

### **USAGE**
To apply this change:
1. Update the container name in `docker-compose.yml` to `hmrs-simulator`.
2. Rename `QUADCOPTER_SIMULATOR_TASKS.md` to `HMRS_SIMULATOR_TASKS.md`.
3. Update all references to `quadcopter-simulator` in documentation files (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/*`).
4. Modify `run_live.sh` to reflect the new container name.
5. Verify all scripts and documentation are consistent.

### **CALLOUTS**
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The renaming ensures the system’s broader applicability is clearly communicated, avoiding confusion about drone type limitations.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Double-check all script and documentation references to `quadcopter-simulator` to avoid breaking dependencies. Test changes in a staging environment before deployment.
