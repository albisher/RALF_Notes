### SUMMARY
Document outlines a structured plan for testing and validating a card database system, including manual and automated verification steps.

### DETAILS
This document serves as a comprehensive testing summary for a card database system, focusing on verifying API integration, UI/UX consistency, and backend database accuracy. It details phases for manual browser verification, automated card creation via JavaScript, visual and functional testing, and database validation. The workflow includes checking card display, types, colors, and interactivity, alongside cross-verification between UI and database records.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **create100StoryCards()**: Automates the generation of 100+ story cards across 13 types using `BROWSER_CARD_CREATION_SCRIPT.js`.
- **Card Tab Navigation**: Manual or automated UI navigation to the Cards tab (with logout issues noted).
- **Database Query Scripts**: SQL queries to validate card counts, types, and data completeness in `psql`.
- **Manual UI Verification**: Checks for grid layout, card details, icons, and interactive features (edit/delete/search).
- **Visual Consistency Checks**: Ensures color schemes, borders, and hover effects align with design specifications.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Browser automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Playwright),
- PostgreSQL (`psql`) for database queries,
- JavaScript console for script execution,
- Flask backend (for API integration),
- `flask_cors` (missing in Python environment),
- Localhost server at `http://localhost:5174`.

### USAGE
1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Access the app via `http://localhost:5174` and log in with credentials (`a`, `spq8`).
   - Navigate to the Cards tab and verify UI elements manually.

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Execute `create100StoryCards()` in the browser console using `BROWSER_CARD_CREATION_SCRIPT.js`.
   - Run SQL queries via `psql` to validate database records.

3. **Cross-Verification**:
   - Compare UI card counts with database records using the provided SQL queries.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Browser Automation Workaround**: The logout issue during Card tab navigation can be bypassed by manually navigating to the URL hash (e.g., `http://localhost:5174/#/cards`) or using direct browser navigation.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Database Dependency**: Ensure PostgreSQL (`psql`) is accessible and configured for the `space_pearl_db` database. Missing `flask_cors` in the Python environment may cause CORS errors during API testing.
