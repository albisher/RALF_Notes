### SUMMARY
Defines a standardized folder structure and conventions for the `ui-beta` Vue.js application, enforcing modular design with the Box pattern and CSS organization.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a strict folder structure for the `ui-beta` application, ensuring consistency across developers. It mandates the use of the Box pattern for business logic, separating concerns into boxes, components, and pages. CSS files must reside exclusively in `/src/styles/` to avoid duplication, with deprecated root-level styles removed post-migration. The structure emphasizes modularity, reusability, and adherence to Vue.js best practices.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **BoxOrchestrator**: Orchestrates execution of Box pattern implementations.
- **BoxInterface/BoxInput/BoxOutput**: Base classes defining the Box pattern contract.
- **api-client.js**: Abstracts API communication for service layer.
- **color-scheme.css**: Centralized CSS variables for theming.
- **common.css**: Shared styles for reusable UI elements.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js, JSDoc, CSS modules, Webpack (or similar bundler), Node.js (for utility scripts).

### USAGE
1. Developers must place all business logic in `/src/boxes/` following the Box pattern.
2. Vue components must use `BoxOrchestrator` to execute boxes, avoiding direct API calls.
3. CSS files must be imported from `/src/styles/` using relative paths.
4. Deprecated `/styles/` directory must be cleaned up during migration.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Box Pattern Enforcement
> All business logic must be encapsulated in Box classes. Components delegate execution to `BoxOrchestrator`, ensuring separation of concerns.
>[!WARNING]- CSS Migration Risk
> Ignoring the `/src/styles/` requirement risks duplicate styles and breaking builds. Enforce this rule strictly during development.
>[!INFO]- Deprecated Files Warning
> Files in `/styles/` are deprecated. Remove them immediately to avoid conflicts during refactoring.
>[!WARNING]- Component Scope
> Components should be small and focused. Overly complex components may violate single-responsibility principles, leading to maintainability issues.
