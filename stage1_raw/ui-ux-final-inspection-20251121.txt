### SUMMARY
Evaluates UI/UX final inspection findings for a web application, focusing on layout correctness and color scheme adherence.

### DETAILS
This report documents a UI/UX final inspection conducted on a web application running at `http://localhost:5174`, using browser automation tools. The inspection verified the implementation of the color scheme, information display quality, and layout correctness across multiple pages, particularly emphasizing the **three-column layout** (e.g., Generation Input, Link Preview, Controls). While the **Generate Stage** passed inspection, the **Link Stage, Timeline Stage, and Story Stage** revealed critical layout issues where the CSS Grid `grid-template-columns` failed to distribute space equally among columns, forcing columns 2 and 3 to occupy ~20% width instead of the expected 33.33%. The root cause was identified as improper constraints (e.g., `min-width: 320px`) overriding the `1fr` distribution logic.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **CSS Grid Layout Inspector**: Validates equal column distribution in three-column layouts.
- **Color Scheme Validator**: Ensures consistent color adherence across pages.
- **Layout Debugger**: Identifies and documents structural misalignments (e.g., squished columns).
- **Browser Automation Tool**: Executes visual checks via automated testing scripts.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Browser automation tools (e.g., Playwright, Selenium)
- CSS Grid framework
- Local development environment (React/Vue/other frontend framework)
- Screenshot capture tools (e.g., Puppeteer)

### USAGE
1. **Inspection Process**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5174` and test each stage (Generate, Link, Timeline, Story).
   - Use browser automation tools to capture screenshots and validate layout metrics.
   - Compare actual vs. expected column widths (33.33% each).

2. **Fix Implementation**:
   - Edit `/Users/amac/Downloads/spq8/ui-beta/src/styles/workflow.css` to replace rigid `min-width` constraints with flexible `minmax(0, 1fr)`.
   - Add `gap: 1rem` for consistent spacing and `overflow-x: auto` for responsive scrolling.

3. **Testing**:
   - Clear browser cache and re-inspect all stages post-fix.
   - Test across device resolutions (1024px, 1440px, 1920px) to ensure adaptability.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical CSS Fix
> The proposed CSS changes (`grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))`) enforce equal column distribution by dynamically allocating space based on content. This resolves the squished columns issue but may require adjustments if content exceeds available width (use `overflow-x: auto` to handle overflow).
>[!WARNING]- Content Overflow Risk
> Without `max-width: 100%` or `overflow: hidden`, columns may overflow beyond viewport boundaries. Ensure all content respects container constraints to avoid usability disruptions.
