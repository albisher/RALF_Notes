### SUMMARY
Script validates backend generator functionality by testing plant, building, robot, and character generators with predefined test cases.

### DETAILS
This script imports a `GeneratorService` from the backend and tests all available generator types (plant, building, robot, character) with multiple test cases per type. Each test case includes a seed value and optional additional metadata. The script validates generated elements by checking for required fields (name and data) and records pass/fail results. Results are saved as both a structured JSON file and a human-readable Markdown report in a `generated_stories/` directory.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **test_generators()**: Orchestrates the entire testing workflow, imports the generator service, and runs all test cases.
- **GeneratorService**: Interface used to generate elements (plant, building, robot, character) with configurable parameters.
- **test_cases**: Dictionary mapping generator types to predefined test inputs (seeds and optional metadata).
- **test_results**: Structured data collection for pass/fail statistics and detailed test outcomes.

### DEPENDENCIES
backend.generator_service, Generators module, datetime, json, sys, os

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly (`python test_generators.py`).
2. The script automatically:
   - Checks generator service availability.
   - Executes tests for each generator type with predefined inputs.
   - Saves results in `generated_stories/` as:
     - `generator_test_results_<timestamp>.json` (structured data)
     - `generator_test_report_<timestamp>.md` (human-readable report).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses a hardcoded `world_id=999` for all tests. This should be replaced with a configurable or dynamic world ID for production use to avoid conflicts between test runs.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> If the `GeneratorService` fails to import or lacks generators, the script exits immediately with an error. Ensure the backend directory is correctly added to `sys.path` and the service is properly initialized.
