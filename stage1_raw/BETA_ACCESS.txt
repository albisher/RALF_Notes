### SUMMARY
Provides beta access URLs, detailed logging configuration, and debugging instructions for a development environment using Docker Compose.

### DETAILS
This document outlines the beta access setup for a production UI and backend API, including primary and alternative URLs for accessing different components. It details comprehensive logging at the **DEBUG** level, covering HTTP requests/responses, database queries, application errors, and box operations. Logs are managed via Docker Compose, with real-time console output and file-based logging in `/app/logs/backend.log`, which rotates automatically to prevent disk overflow. The document also includes commands for starting, stopping, and debugging services, along with health checks and API testing instructions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Primary UI-Beta**: Main production UI with all features (generate, link, card, timeline, story stages).
- **Backend API Direct/Proxy**: Endpoints for API interactions (`/api`).
- **Frontend (Vue Dev)**: Development frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.
- **Health Check**: Endpoint to verify backend health (`/health`).
- **Log Rotation**: Automated log management with max file size of 10MB and 5 backups.

### DEPENDENCIES
Docker Compose, backend container, proxy container, static files container.

### USAGE
1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services.
2. Access the UI at `http://localhost:8888/ui-beta/` or `https://localhost:8443/ui-beta/`.
3. Monitor logs with `docker-compose logs -f backend` or view files via `docker-compose cp backend:/app/logs/backend.log ./backend-logs/`.
4. Debug issues using provided commands (e.g., `docker-compose ps`, `curl` for API testing).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Debug logging is enabled by default, which logs all HTTP requests/responses and application events. Ensure sensitive data is masked in logs to avoid exposure.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Logs are stored persistently in `/app/logs/backend.log` inside the container. Regularly back up logs to avoid data loss during container restarts or crashes.
