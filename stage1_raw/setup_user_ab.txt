### SUMMARY
Script for setting up or updating a user 'ab' with password reassignment and data migration to this user.

### DETAILS
This script uses Flask and SQLAlchemy to create or update a user named 'ab' with a predefined password. It checks if the user exists, updates the password if found, or creates a new user. If other users exist, it reassigns all their associated data (worlds, elements, timelines, events, preferences, etc.) to the new user 'ab'. The script gracefully handles missing models (e.g., `Card`) by skipping reassignment for those entities.

The script dynamically checks for optional models (`Card`, `Link`, `CustomGenerator`) and skips reassignment if they are not available. It logs progress and errors during the reassignment process.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **setup_user_ab()**: Core function that creates/updates user 'ab' and reassigns all data from other users to this user.
- **generate_password_hash()**: Uses Flask-Werkzeug to hash the password for secure storage.
- **create_access_token()**: (Indirectly used) Generates JWT tokens for authentication (though not explicitly called in this script).

### DEPENDENCIES
Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended, SQLAlchemy, Werkzeug, `app` (Flask app instance), `models` (SQLAlchemy models including `User`, `World`, `Timeline`, etc.).

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly (`python setup_user_ab.py`).
2. The script will:
   - Check if user 'ab' exists.
   - Update the password if the user exists.
   - Create a new user 'ab' if it does not exist.
   - Reassign all data (worlds, elements, timelines, etc.) from other users to 'ab'.
3. Logs progress and errors during execution.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Dynamic Model Handling
> The script dynamically checks for optional models (`Card`, `Link`, `CustomGenerator`) using `try-except` blocks. If these models are missing, reassignment for those entities is skipped with a warning.
>
>[!WARNING]- Data Reassignment Risks
> Reassigning all data to a single user may cause data loss or corruption if:
> - The reassignment fails partially (e.g., some tables fail silently).
> - The original user data is not backed up before reassignment.
> - Foreign key constraints are violated during updates. The script uses `synchronize_session=False` for `TimelineEvent` updates to avoid cascading issues.
