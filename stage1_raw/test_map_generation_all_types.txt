### SUMMARY
Tests hash-based heightmap generation across multiple world types for procedural map creation.

### DETAILS
This script validates the new hash-based heightmap generation system by testing it against predefined world types (planet, galaxy, cloud-world, etc.). It creates test Voronoi cells, applies the generator for each world type, and evaluates success/failure based on heightmap generation. The test outputs statistics (average/min/max heights) and saves results to JSON for analysis.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **create_test_cells(num_cells)**: Generates distributed Voronoi cells for testing.
- **test_world_type(world_type, world_hash, cells)**: Executes heightmap generation for a specific world type with given inputs.
- **main()**: Orchestrates testing across all world types, collects results, and reports success/failure metrics.

### DEPENDENCIES
`sys`, `os`, `json`, `pathlib`, `backend` (local module), `boxes.generators.world_type_heightmap_generator_box`, `boxes.core.box_interface`

### USAGE
1. Run script directly (`python test_map_generation_all_types.py`).
2. Script automatically:
   - Creates test cells.
   - Tests each world type with predefined hash and description.
   - Prints success/failure stats and saves results to `screenshots/map_generation_tests/test_results.json`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Test Structure
> Each world type is tested with identical cells but unique `world_hash` to simulate distinct environments. The script validates heightmap generation consistency across types.
>[!WARNING]- Error Handling
> Failed tests log errors but continue execution—results are still saved to preserve data integrity.
