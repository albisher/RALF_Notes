### SUMMARY
Critical fixes applied to a reinforcement learning system to address 100% failure rate by enabling learning from failures, improving reward shaping, and enhancing exploration.

### DETAILS
This document outlines critical fixes for a machine learning system that previously achieved 0% success rate due to exclusive learning from successful experiences. The fixes include:
- **Learning from all experiences** (not just successes) with weighted rewards.
- **Reward shaping** to provide partial credit for progress, encouraging gradual improvement.
- **Epsilon-greedy exploration** to balance exploitation and exploration.
- **Full-layer backpropagation** for improved gradient updates.
- **Simplified initial scenarios** to make learning achievable.
- **Optimized learning parameters** (higher learning rate, more frequent updates).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`swarm/ml_controller.py`**: Core learning algorithm with full-layer backpropagation and reward-weighted updates.
- **`swarm/learning_drone.py`**: Implements reward shaping and continuous feedback for partial success.
- **`swarm/scenario_generator.py`**: Adjusts initial conditions (orientation, position) to reduce difficulty.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Reinforcement learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Neural network frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Containerized simulation environment (e.g., Docker)

### USAGE
To monitor progress:
1. Track success rate over time.
2. Observe reward distribution (increase in positive rewards).
3. Check distance errors and exploration rate trends.
4. Verify scenario improvements in modified files.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The system now learns from both successes and failures, reducing reliance on perfect outcomes. Continuous monitoring is required to confirm gradual improvement.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Overly aggressive exploration (epsilon-greedy) may cause instability early on. Ensure exploration rate decays smoothly to avoid premature convergence.
