### SUMMARY
A Vue.js component managing the research and news page view with a single responsibility for displaying news and research content.

### DETAILS
This component implements a Vue.js single-page application (SPA) component that dynamically renders a research/news view based on the `currentView` prop. It dynamically loads the `ResearchNewsViewComponent` only if it exists, ensuring lazy loading. The template conditionally renders a wrapper div containing the research/news view component when `currentView` is set to `'research-news'`. The component adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing solely on rendering the news/research content.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`research-news-page-component`**: Main component that conditionally renders the research/news view based on the `currentView` prop.
- **`components` object**: Dynamically includes `research-news-view-component` if available (lazy loading).
- **`template`**: Conditional rendering logic for the research/news view wrapper.

### DEPENDENCIES
ResearchNewsViewComponent (must be defined or imported)

### USAGE
```javascript
<research-news-page-component :current-view="'research-news'" />
```
- Set `currentView` to `'research-news'` to trigger rendering of the research/news view.
- If `ResearchNewsViewComponent` is not available, it defaults to an empty object (no rendering).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Lazy Loading
> The component checks for `ResearchNewsViewComponent` at runtime to avoid unnecessary imports, improving performance.
>[!WARNING]- Prop Validation
> Ensure `currentView` is always a string and required; invalid values will cause runtime errors.
