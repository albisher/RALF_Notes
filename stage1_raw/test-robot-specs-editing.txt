### SUMMARY
Tests robot specification editing functionality in a web application using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing of a web interface for editing robot specifications. It launches a browser, navigates to a character detail page, verifies the presence of edit functionality, and checks for robot-specific form fields (e.g., faction, arms, eyes) and modifications fields (e.g., color adjustments, feature modifications). It captures screenshots at key stages and logs interactions with the UI.

The test follows these steps:
1. Launches Puppeteer with a browser, sets viewport, and navigates to a character detail page.
2. Takes an initial screenshot and retrieves the character name.
3. Locates and clicks the edit button, then takes another screenshot.
4. Validates the presence of robot specifications and modifications sections.
5. Checks for specific input fields (e.g., faction, arms, color adjustments) and logs their values.
6. Optionally fills in sample values in selected fields to simulate editing.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testRobotSpecsEditing**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including browser setup, UI interactions, and screenshot capture.
- **puppeteer.launch**: Initializes a browser instance with customizable settings (headless mode, sandbox bypass).
- **page.goto**: Navigates to the target URL (`http://localhost:5173/characters/289`).
- **page.$eval**/**page.$**: Selects and extracts text/content from DOM elements.
- **page.screenshot**: Captures visual snapshots of the page at critical points.
- **page.type**: Simulates typing into input fields (e.g., faction, arms).

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node test-robot-specs-editing.js`.
3. Ensure the target URL (`http://localhost:5173/characters/289`) is accessible and the UI matches expected selectors.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes the UI structure matches the selectors used (e.g., `button[icon="mdi-pencil"]`, `input[placeholder*="Knowledge Keepers"]`). If the actual UI differs, adjust selectors accordingly.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid running in headless mode (`--headless: true`) if debugging UI interactions, as visual feedback may be limited. The script includes delays (`waitForTimeout`) to account for dynamic content loading.
