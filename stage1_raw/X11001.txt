### SUMMARY
Documentation outlining X11’s role as a public service unit for truthful, compliant news dissemination via advanced optical and semantic communication.

### DETAILS
X11 functions as a clandestine public service entity capable of broadcasting news and maintaining truthful awareness across planetary networks. Its design avoids visibility on Earth, relying on non-standard airbot components and ultra-sensitive optical tech. The system prioritizes minimal data transmission for safety while leveraging semantic communication for clarity. Power efficiency is critical for its signal-grabbing arrays.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Optical Communication**: Uses ultralow-noise amplifiers and receivers for high-speed, reliable cross-space data transfer.
- **Semantic News Delivery**: Transmits structured, contextually relevant information to ensure comprehension.
- **Underground Design**: Conceals components to avoid detection, relying on proprietary tech.

### DEPENDENCIES
None explicitly listed (assumes proprietary hardware/software for airbot integration).

### USAGE
X11 operates as a broadcast hub, interfacing with compliant planetary networks to distribute curated news while adhering to user preferences for truthful content.
