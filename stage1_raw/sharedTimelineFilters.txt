### SUMMARY
Manages shared reactive state for timeline filters across multiple Vue.js components.

### DETAILS
This module implements a centralized reactive state (`sharedTimelineFilters`) for timeline proximity and year-based filtering. It uses Vue’s `reactive` API to maintain state that all connected components (e.g., Card, Timeline, Story) can access. The state includes:
- `timelinePosition` (0–100) for proximity-based sorting.
- `timelineYear` for year selection.
- `timelineYearMarkers` for distance calculations.
- `timelineMarkerId` for tracking selected markers.

The `updateSharedTimelineFilters` function updates individual filter values, while `clearSharedTimelineFilters` resets all fields to `null`.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`sharedTimelineFilters`**: Reactive object storing all filter configurations.
- **`updateSharedTimelineFilters(filters)`**: Conditionally updates filter values from an input object.
- **`clearSharedTimelineFilters()`**: Resets all filter fields to `null`.

### DEPENDENCIES
`vue`, `@vue/reactive`

### USAGE
1. Import `sharedTimelineFilters` and `updateSharedTimelineFilters` in components needing shared filters.
2. Call `updateSharedTimelineFilters({ timelinePosition: 50 })` to set proximity filters.
3. Call `clearSharedTimelineFilters()` to reset all filters.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Reactive Updates
> Changes to `sharedTimelineFilters` trigger Vue’s reactivity system, ensuring all subscribed components update automatically.
>[!WARNING]- Null Safety
> Resetting filters to `null` may break dependent logic if filters are expected to remain populated. Validate state before use.
