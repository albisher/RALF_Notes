### SUMMARY
Automated UI test suite for character generation workflow using Puppeteer to validate hash, random, and manual character creation.

### DETAILS
This script automates testing of a character generation UI by:
1. Launching a browser, navigating to the application, and capturing screenshots at each step.
2. Testing three generation methods: hash-based (with seed input), random, and manual (name/description fields).
3. Validating UI elements like buttons, radio inputs, and form fields interactively.
4. Recording browser console/network activity and saving screenshots to a directory.

The workflow follows a structured sequence: load app → navigate to workspace → open asset creator → test each generation method sequentially.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testCharacterGenerationUI**: Orchestrates the full test suite with steps for each character generation method.
- **takeScreenshot**: Captures full-page screenshots with timestamped filenames.
- **create screenshots directory**: Initializes a directory for saving screenshots programmatically.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Run as a Node.js script (`node test-character-generation-ui.js`).
2. Ensure the target application is running at `http://localhost:5173`.
3. The script creates a `screenshots` folder in the same directory for visual logs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `waitForTimeout` for delays, which may not be ideal for flaky tests. Consider replacing with explicit waits (e.g., `page.waitForSelector`) where possible.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless mode is disabled (`--no-sandbox` is used instead). Ensure the target environment allows this configuration to avoid security warnings.
