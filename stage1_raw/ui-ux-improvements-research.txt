### SUMMARY
Explores UI/UX enhancements for a card/world creation application, focusing on navigation, visualization, and user workflows.

### DETAILS
This document analyzes the current UI components of **WorldCardBuilder.vue**, identifying pain points in tab navigation, hash generation, timeline visualization, and card builder workflows. It then aligns these findings with UI/UX best practices, including progressive disclosure, visual feedback, and interactive timelines. The research proposes structured improvements across dashboard design, card management, form workflows, and responsive design, prioritizing phases for implementation. It also recommends tools like **Vue Draggable** and **Vuetify** for development.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **WorldCardBuilder.vue**: Main application page with tabbed navigation for world creation, hash generation, card building, and documentation.
- **Timeline View**: Identified as needing a visual timeline representation with interactive navigation.
- **Hash Generation Panel**: Requires live preview and batch generation improvements.
- **Card Builder**: Needs drag-and-drop and live preview functionality.
- **Dashboard/Home Page**: Should include quick start guides and recent activity feeds.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js, Vuetify, Vue Draggable, Vue Timeline, Vue Virtual Scroller, Vue Toastification, Vue Loading Overlay

### USAGE
This document serves as a research foundation for UI/UX improvements in a card/world creation application. It guides implementation priorities (Phase 1: Visual timeline, search, etc.) and suggests tools/libraries for development.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Workflow Gap**
> Current tab navigation lacks clear guidance, risking user confusion. Implementing a persistent sidebar navigation and breadcrumbs will improve discoverability.
>[!WARNING]- **Performance Risk**
> Timeline visualization with virtual scrolling must be optimized to avoid lag in large datasets. Lazy loading and caching are essential for scalability.
