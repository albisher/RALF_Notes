### SUMMARY
Renames and documents the reassessment of a folder to better reflect its content.

### DETAILS
This document details the assessment of the `whats_working` folder, which was renamed to `development-log` due to its misleading name. The folder contained 132 markdown files categorized into completed fixes, investigations, implementations, verifications, and issue reports. The old name was inaccurate because it included incomplete or unresolved items, while the new name better captures the folder’s purpose as a comprehensive development history and changelog.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Folder Renaming**: Renamed `whats_working` to `development-log` to reflect accurate content.
- **Content Analysis**: Classified 132 files into categories like fixes, investigations, and verifications.
- **Reference Update**: Updated internal and external references to the new folder name.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone documentation log).

### USAGE
This document serves as a record of the folder reassessment, useful for maintaining consistency in project documentation and ensuring references are updated correctly.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Ensure all external references to `whats_working` are updated to `development-log` to avoid confusion in future documentation or collaboration.
