### SUMMARY
UI/UX testing report documenting critical navigation failures in the Timeline stage, functional but flawed World Management modal, and pending DB persistence verification for a web application.

### DETAILS
This report evaluates three key areas: **Timeline Stage navigation** (broken via URL), **World Management modal** (functional but with WebSocket timeout in dropdown), and **DB persistence** (blocked by Timeline access). The Timeline stage lacks proper route handling in Vue Router, preventing direct access. The World Management modal works structurally but has a WebSocket timeout during dropdown selection, causing UI inconsistency. The report highlights technical dependencies like Vue Router and WebSocket interactions, requiring fixes before further testing.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Timeline Stage Navigation**: Handles URL-based route transitions for event management.
- **World Management Modal**: Creates new worlds with fields (name, type, metadata) and dropdowns.
- **DB Persistence Verification**: Confirms event/world data storage integrity.
- **Vue Router**: Manages application navigation and route state.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Powers dynamic dropdown options (e.g., World Type).

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue Router, WebSocket API, Vue.js (for reactive state management), Backend DB (for persistence).

### USAGE
To reproduce issues:
1. **Timeline Stage**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/#/timeline` (fails silently).
2. **World Management**: Trigger via "Create World" button (modal opens but dropdown may timeout).
3. **DB Persistence**: Requires fixed Timeline stage to test event storage.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Block**: Timeline stage navigation failure prevents testing of event persistence and UI/UX.
> The Vue Router must be reconfigured to handle hash-based routes (e.g., `createWebHashHistory`).
>[!WARNING]- **WebSocket Timeout**: Dropdown interactions stall after 30s, breaking user flow.
> Implement async error handling or reduce timeout thresholds for dropdowns.
