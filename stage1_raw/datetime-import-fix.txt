### TYPE
code-fix

### SUMMARY
Fixes missing `datetime` import causing `NameError` in drone simulation code.

### DETAILS
The code originally failed due to an undefined `datetime` module in `base_drone.py`, despite its usage in timestamp formatting. The root issue was an oversight in importing the module, which was resolved by adding `from datetime import datetime` to the imports section. The fix ensures ISO-formatted timestamps are generated correctly in methods like `get_state()` and `apply_thrust()`, maintaining compatibility with containerized environments.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **get_state()**: Generates and returns ISO-formatted timestamps for state messages.
- **apply_thrust()**: Uses `datetime.now()` for timestamping thrust-related operations.
- **All message timestamps**: All occurrences of timestamp generation rely on the `datetime` module.

### DEPENDENCIES
`pybullet`, `numpy`, `typing`, `time`

### USAGE
The fix requires updating `simulation/swarm/base_drone.py` to include the `datetime` import. After applying, restart the container or ensure the file is synced to reflect changes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Container Sync
> If running in a container, ensure the updated file is synced to the container before execution to avoid runtime errors.
>[!WARNING]- Restart Required
> After modifying the import, restart the container to load the updated `datetime` import.
