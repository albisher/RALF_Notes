### SUMMARY
Validates task dependencies in a project to detect issues like circular references, missing tasks, and logical inconsistencies.

### DETAILS
This script (`validate-dependencies`) performs a comprehensive analysis of task dependencies within a project management system. It checks for circular dependencies (e.g., Task A → B → A), missing or invalid task references, and logical inconsistencies (e.g., completed tasks depending on pending ones). The tool generates a structured report with warnings, errors, and critical path analysis, including suggested optimizations and fixes.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`validate-dependencies`**: Runs the full dependency validation across the project.
- **`fix-dependencies`**: Automatically resolves detected issues (e.g., removes circular references).
- **Dependency Graph Visualization**: Generates a visual representation of task relationships.
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identifies the longest sequence of dependent tasks.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluates the severity of each issue (warnings vs. errors).

### DEPENDENCIES
`task-master` (core project management CLI tool), Graphviz (for dependency graph visualization), optional: `tm` (task management library).

### USAGE
1. Execute via CLI:
   ```bash
   task-master validate-dependencies
   ```
2. Review the generated report for issues (warnings/errors).
3. Use `/project:tm/fix-dependencies` to auto-resolve critical problems.
4. Manually adjust dependencies if needed and rerun validation.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Path Note
> The "Critical Path" in the report determines the project’s minimum completion time. Any delays here cascade to other tasks.
>[!WARNING]- Auto-Fix Limitation
> `/project:tm/fix-dependencies` only resolves simple cases (e.g., circular refs). Complex fixes may require manual review.
