### SUMMARY
Verifies UI completeness and integration of a map generator system, detailing frontend/backend setup and next steps for full testing.

### DETAILS
This document confirms the UI verification of a **Map Generator** system, including functional form components, frontend integration, and backend service readiness. The verification covers all UI elements (form inputs, preview, controls) and confirms the system’s modular architecture with FastAPI backend and Vue.js frontend components. The service setup is documented, including Docker configuration, but requires manual execution for full testing. The next steps involve running the service and validating end-to-end workflows (generation + story integration).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **MapGeneratorForm.vue**: Handles user input for map parameters (seed, resolution, biome settings).
- **MapPreview.vue**: Displays generated 2D maps with coordinates and controls.
- **MapGeneratorServiceBox.js**: Manages API communication between frontend and backend.
- **MapStoryIntegrationBox.js**: Links generated maps to story system (e.g., location cards).
- **api.py**: FastAPI endpoints for map generation (Voronoi, heightmap, biome, city placement).
- **Dockerfile**: Containerizes the backend service with resource limits and health checks.
- **job_manager.py**: Manages background processing for large-scale map generation.

### DEPENDENCIES
FastAPI, Docker, Voronoi algorithm libraries (e.g., `scipy`), Azgaar heightmap algorithm, Biome classification tools, City placement engines, Vue.js 3, `docker-compose`, `curl`.

### USAGE
1. **Start Service**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d map-generator
   ```
2. **Test UI**:
   - Access `http://localhost:5174/#maps` to interact with the form.
3. **Generate Map**:
   - Fill form parameters, click "Generate Map," and monitor progress.
4. **Story Integration**:
   - Use "Save to World" to create location cards in the story system.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Service Dependency
> The backend service must be running (`docker-compose up`) to validate end-to-end generation. UI verification alone does not test backend functionality.
>[!WARNING]- Resource Limits
> Docker container limits (CPU/memory) may affect performance for high-resolution maps. Test with realistic settings to avoid crashes.
