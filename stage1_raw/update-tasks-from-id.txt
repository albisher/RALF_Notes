### SUMMARY
A script to update multiple tasks in a workflow system starting from a specified ID, applying context-driven changes intelligently.

### DETAILS
This script automates bulk updates to tasks within a task management system, starting from a given task ID. It intelligently selects tasks (including dependencies and related subtasks) and applies context-specific modifications (e.g., descriptions, test strategies, time estimates) while preserving consistency across related tasks. The process includes previewing changes, user confirmation, and safety features like rollback and validation checks.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`update-tasks-from-id`**: Parses and executes bulk updates from a specified task ID with a given context.
- **`scope-detection`**: Identifies related tasks, subtasks, and logical boundaries to limit unnecessary updates.
- **`context-application`**: Applies AI-driven changes (e.g., descriptions, test strategies) while maintaining consistency.
- **`preview-and-confirm`**: Displays a summary of changes before execution for user validation.
- **`safety-features`**: Implements rollback, change logging, and validation checks to mitigate errors.

### DEPENDENCIES
`task-master` CLI tool (assumed to be a task management framework), `bash` scripting environment.

### USAGE
1. Run the script via CLI:
   ```bash
   /project:tm/update/from-id <starting_id> "<update_context>"
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   /project:tm/update/from-id 5 "change database to PostgreSQL"
   ```
2. Follow prompts to preview changes and confirm execution.
3. Review the summary of applied updates and consistency checks post-update.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Scope Detection**
> The script uses smart boundary detection to avoid over-updating unrelated tasks, grouping logically connected tasks for efficiency.
>[!WARNING]- **Context Sensitivity**
> Incorrect context may lead to unintended changes; always review the preview before confirming updates.
>[!INFO]- **Safety First**
> Changes are logged, and a rollback is available if issues arise during execution.
