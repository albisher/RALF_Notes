### SUMMARY
Document outlining PyBullet installation challenges on macOS and alternative solutions for simulation needs.

### DETAILS
This document addresses PyBullet installation failures on macOS due to zlib macro conflicts during compilation. It provides multiple solutions, including using a working visual demo (which meets HMRS requirements) and detailed instructions for manual builds, Conda environments, or Docker containers. The visual demo leverages `numpy` and `matplotlib` to simulate multi-robot systems, sensors, and real-time physics without requiring full PyBullet compilation.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`run_visual_demo.py`**: Demonstrates multi-robot simulation, sensor visualization (LiDAR), and control systems using `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
- **`pybullet` (manual build)**: Full physics simulation library requiring compilation from source.
- **`bullet3` (GitHub repo)**: Source code for PyBullet, built via CMake.

### DEPENDENCIES
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `python3.10`, `cmake`, `pkg-config`, `git`, `brew` (for macOS), `conda` (optional), `docker` (optional).

### USAGE
1. **For HMRS verification**: Run `run_visual_demo.py` in the virtual environment (venv) to validate requirements.
2. **For full PyBullet**: Follow manual build steps (CMake, compilation) or use Conda/Docker as alternatives.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The visual demo is sufficient for HMRS requirements but lacks advanced physics capabilities. Full PyBullet installation is only needed for precise physics simulations.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Manual compilation may fail due to macOS-specific zlib conflicts. Test builds in a clean environment before integration.
