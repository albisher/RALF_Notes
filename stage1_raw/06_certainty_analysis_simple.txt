### SUMMARY
Analyzes a sci-fi procedural content system’s architecture, certainty ratings, and technical dependencies for a "Space Peral" universe.

### DETAILS
This document evaluates a **procedural content generation system** for a sci-fi universe, structured as a checklist of verified points with user-rated certainty scores. The system uses **deterministic hash-based algorithms** (SHA-256) to generate robots, plants, buildings, and characters via Python/Flask backend and Blender for 3D modeling. Content attributes are defined in **text-based configuration files**, organized modularly by content type (e.g., robots, plants). The design emphasizes **reproducibility** and **extensibility**, with dependencies including Flask, Blender, and Python libraries (numpy, pandas). The document also covers integration points, performance, and world-building elements like the colony’s environment and key NPCs (e.g., X-Series robots).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Procedural Content Generation**: Uses hash-based selection from predefined attribute lists for deterministic outputs.
- **Modular Generators**: Separate generators for robots, plants, buildings, and characters with configurable attributes.
- **Flask Web Interface**: Enables user interaction for content generation and visualization.
- **Blender Integration**: Handles 3D model creation and export via Python API (bpy).
- **Text-Based Configuration**: Stores attributes in structured text files (JSON/text lists) for easy editing.

### DEPENDENCIES
Python (with `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`), Flask, Blender, text files for configuration.

### USAGE
1. **Checklist Review**: Users verify points and rate certainty (e.g., 95% for Flask backend).
2. **Content Generation**: Flask web app generates procedurally via hash inputs; Blender renders 3D models.
3. **Extensibility**: Add new content types by creating modular generators with text configs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Deterministic Outputs**: Same input hash always produces identical content, ensuring reproducibility for testing/validation.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Text-File Dependency**: Critical to maintain/configure attribute lists in text files; errors may break generation if files are corrupted or misnamed.
