### SUMMARY
Script automates screenshot verification for map generation tests, ensuring consistency between world types and hash-based deterministic outputs.

### DETAILS
This Bash script organizes and structures screenshots for verifying map generation logic. It dynamically creates a timestamped directory (`YYYYMMDD/HHMM`) under a base path (`screenshots/map_generation_ui_tests`) to store screenshots. The script guides users to capture screenshots for:
- **World-type validation** (Planet, Galaxy, Cloud World) in initial states and generated maps.
- **Hash-based reproducibility** (e.g., same hash input → identical map output).

The script suggests naming conventions (e.g., `planet-map-generated-1.png` vs. `planet-map-generated-2.png` for comparison). Users must manually trigger browser automation to capture screenshots, which are then saved for later verification.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`date +%Y%m%d`**: Generates a date-based directory identifier (e.g., `20240101`).
- **`date +%H%M`**: Generates a time-based subdirectory (e.g., `1430`).
- **`mkdir -p`**: Creates nested directories without errors if they exist.
- **User prompts**: Guides screenshot naming conventions for deterministic validation.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Bash shell (for directory creation and date formatting).
- Browser automation tools (e.g., Puppeteer, Selenium) for capturing screenshots.

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a terminal to generate a timestamped directory.
2. Manually capture screenshots using browser automation tools, following naming conventions.
3. Verify generated maps match expected outputs (e.g., identical for same hash inputs).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Directory Structure**: Screenshots must follow `YYYYMMDD/HHMM/` to align with script logic. Delete old directories if space is limited.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Manual Steps Required**: The script does not automate screenshot capture—users must use browser automation tools to ensure consistency. Inconsistent naming may invalidate verification.
