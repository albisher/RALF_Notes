### SUMMARY
Explores design patterns for separating mental/behavioral aspects (character AI) from physical robot embodiment in game development, focusing on database schema, UI integration, and decoupled architecture.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a structured approach to designing character-robot relationships by splitting behavioral logic (e.g., AI states, personality, goals) from physical attributes (e.g., 3D models, animations, physics). The separation is implemented via modular database tables (`Character` and `Robot`), JSONB fields for flexible AI/animation data, and decoupled UI components (e.g., editors for behavior vs. physics). Backend APIs and frontend Vue modules manage these layers independently while synchronizing updates. Research-backed examples (e.g., bipedal robotics, game design) validate the approach.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Behavioral Separation**: Abstracts AI logic (e.g., behavior trees) from robot locomotion/physics.
- **Database Schema**: Uses `Character` (mental/behavioral) and `Robot` (physical) tables with JSONB for evolving data.
- **UI Modularity**: Vue components (`CharacterBehaviorEditor`, `RobotPhysicalEditor`) render distinct layers via API endpoints.
- **World Integration**: Links robot presence to a 3D globe while overlaying character mental states in side panels.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks changes separately for character/robot data to maintain version history.

### DEPENDENCIES
PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy (backend), Vue.js (frontend), JSONB extensions for flexible data storage.

### USAGE
1. **Backend**: Extend `WorldElement` with `Character`/`Robot` tables, use JSONB for dynamic AI/physics data.
2. **Frontend**: Create Vue components for each layer, bind to backend APIs, and visualize robot movement on a globe.
3. **Sync**: Implement offline-first sync for character/robot data separately (Task 11).
4. **Audit**: Log changes to both layers independently (Task 20).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Behavioral-Animation Decoupling**
> Research in robotics (e.g., bipedal locomotion) shows that separating steering logic (behavior) from animation/physics reduces complexity. Apply this to your game by treating AI decisions and robot movements as distinct pipelines.

>[!WARNING]- **Data Consistency Risks**
> Ensure foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity between `Character` and `Robot` tables. JSONB fields may require validation for schema evolution; test edge cases (e.g., orphaned robots or missing characters).
