### SUMMARY
Explores hash-based techniques to generate and optimize related maps within a world using a hierarchical hash structure for deterministic and mathematically related content generation.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a method to generate related map components (heightmaps, biomes, cities, etc.) using a hierarchical hash system rooted in a world hash. The approach ensures consistency across maps derived from the same world while allowing variations for distinct but related map types. The system replaces string-based concatenation with a deterministic hash-based method, ensuring reproducibility and mathematical relationships between map elements.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`generate_world_hash`**: Creates a deterministic hash for the entire world based on name, type, and user ID.
- **`generate_related_hash`**: Produces a related hash by combining a base world hash with a variation string (e.g., "heightmap").
- **`WorldTypeHeightmapGenerator`**: Generates heightmaps using a hash-based seed derived from the world hash.
- **`WorldTypeCityPlacer`**: Places cities using a hash-based seed for deterministic placement.
- **`generate_related_hash` (cell-specific)**: Dynamically generates cell-specific hashes for fine-grained control in heightmap generation.

### DEPENDENCIES
`HashGenerator`, `WorldTypeHeightmapGenerator`, `WorldTypeCityPlacer`, `random` (for fallback deterministic logic), custom hash-based assignment functions (`assign_float`).

### USAGE
1. **Generate World Hash**: Use `generate_world_hash` to create a base hash for the world.
2. **Generate Related Hashes**: For each map component (e.g., heightmap, biome), use `generate_related_hash` with the world hash and a variation string (e.g., `"heightmap"`).
3. **Initialize Generators**: Pass the related hash to generators like `WorldTypeHeightmapGenerator` to ensure deterministic and related map generation.
4. **Extend for Multiple Maps**: Generate multiple maps for the same world by creating distinct variation strings (e.g., `"map_terrain"`, `"map_political"`).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **World Hash as Foundation**
> The world hash serves as the foundational seed for all related map components, ensuring deterministic relationships between maps (e.g., same world + "heightmap" variation always produces the same heightmap).
>
>[!WARNING]- **Fallback Randomness Risk**
> If hash-based logic fails, the current implementation still uses randomness for cell-specific heights. Ensure deterministic fallback mechanisms are robust to avoid inconsistencies.
