### SUMMARY
Automated visual and functional testing framework for web applications using Puppeteer.

### DETAILS
This script implements a `ComprehensiveVisualTest` class to perform automated visual and functional tests on a web application running on `localhost:8443`. It uses Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, captures screenshots, and validates API responses and UI elements. The class includes methods for health checks, login page validation, and authentication testing, logging results to track test success/failure.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`init()`**: Initializes browser, creates screenshot directory, and launches Puppeteer.
- **`takeScreenshot(name, description)`**: Captures a screenshot of the current page with a timestamped filename.
- **`logResult(testName, success, details)`**: Records test outcomes in an array and logs them to the console.
- **`testHealthCheck()`**: Verifies API health by checking for `"status":"healthy"` in the response.
- **`testLoginPage()`**: Validates the presence of login form elements (form, username, password, submit button).
- **`testAuthentication()`**: Simulates login with test credentials and checks for successful redirection to a dashboard.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Instantiate `ComprehensiveVisualTest` and call `init()` to set up the browser.
2. Call test methods sequentially (e.g., `testHealthCheck()`, `testLoginPage()`) to validate functionality.
3. Review `testResults` array for aggregated outcomes or log entries for debugging.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses a headless browser with aggressive security flags (`--disable-web-security`, `--ignore-ssl-errors`), which may not work in production environments. Test locally first.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Avoid hardcoding credentials in `testAuthentication()`. Use environment variables or a secure config file instead.
