### SUMMARY
Automates creation of predefined buildings in a space-themed application using Puppeteer for browser automation.

### DETAILS
This script automates the process of creating multiple buildings in a virtual space application (likely a simulation or game) by:
1. Launching a browser (Chrome/Chromium) in non-headless mode.
2. Navigating through the application’s workspace interface.
3. Dynamically identifying and interacting with UI elements (create buttons, dropdowns, text inputs) to populate building details.
4. Capturing screenshots at key steps for debugging and verification.
The script defines a list of buildings with names, descriptions, and coordinates (though coordinates are not directly used in the UI interaction logic).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **createBuildings()**: Orchestrates the entire workflow, including browser setup, UI navigation, and building creation.
- **takeScreenshot()**: Helper function to save screenshots with timestamps to a `screenshots` directory.
- **Manual UI interaction loops**: Dynamically finds and clicks buttons, selects dropdown options, and fills text fields based on placeholder text.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Save the script as `space-peral-session-4-buildings.js`.
2. Ensure the application is running locally at `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Run the script: `node space-peral-session-4-buildings.js`.
4. Verify the output directory (`screenshots`) contains screenshots and logs.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the UI structure remains consistent (e.g., button/textarea placeholders). If the application updates its UI, selectors may break.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running in non-headless mode (`--no-sandbox`) may expose the system to security risks if the browser is compromised. Use with caution in production environments.
