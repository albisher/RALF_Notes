### SUMMARY
Verifies the accessibility and functionality of frontend/backend assets refactor components.

### DETAILS
This script performs a multi-step verification of an assets refactor by:
1. Checking frontend accessibility via a local web server (port 5173)
2. Validating the assets route endpoint (port 5173/assets)
3. Confirming backend health (port 5000/api/health)
4. Testing the assets API endpoint (port 5000/api/worlds/9/elements) with authentication handling

The verification includes both success and error cases, with detailed logging for each step.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **verifyAssetsRefactor()**: Orchestrates the complete verification workflow.
- **axios.get()**: Used internally for HTTP requests to frontend/backend endpoints.
- **Error handling**: Differentiates between expected authentication errors and unexpected failures.

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install axios`
2. Run verification: `node verify-assets-refactor.js`
3. Check console output for verification results

### RELATED
[[none]]

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script intentionally logs authentication errors (401) as expected behavior for the assets API endpoint, rather than failing verification.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Verify the correct ports (5173, 5000) match your local development environment before running. Localhost access assumes services are running on these ports.
