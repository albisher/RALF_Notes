### SUMMARY
Comprehensive drone command session test suite verifying session creation, drone spawning, and command-response workflows.

### DETAILS
This test validates the full command flow in a drone simulation system, including session initialization, drone spawning, and execution of `move_to`/`hover` commands. It verifies command queuing, drone response handling, and movement validation through multiple API endpoints. The test employs retry logic for state checks and handles visualization delays gracefully.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`test_drone_command_session.py`**: Main test script orchestrating session lifecycle and command execution.
- **`/api/health`**: Server health check endpoint.
- **`/api/reset`**: Clears simulation state before testing.
- **`/api/start`**: Initiates a new session.
- **`/api/spawn`**: Creates drone instances for testing.
- **`/api/command`**: Sends commands (e.g., `move_to`, `hover`) to drones.
- **`/api/master/commands`**: Inspects command queue status.
- **`/api/communication`**: Logs drone interaction data.

### DEPENDENCIES
`requests` (for HTTP API calls), `json` (for output storage), `time` (for delays), `os` (for path handling).

### USAGE
Execute via:
```bash
cd simulation
python test_drone_command_session.py
```
Results are saved to `simulation_output/hmrs_live_verification/drone_command_session_test.json`.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Test uses retry logic (up to 3 attempts) for critical state checks (e.g., session activation, drone spawning) to handle transient failures.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Visualization lag may cause delays in drone movement verification. The test considers command queue status as a valid success indicator if drone fails to respond visually.
