### SUMMARY
Tracks drone session creation for different drone types with movement verification statuses and next steps for troubleshooting.

### DETAILS
This document records four drone sessions (Butterfly, Owl, Bee, Quadcopter) created on **2025-12-13**, noting successful session creation but pending movement verification. Each session logs drone type, ID, and location, while highlighting that **200 position updates were recorded but no movement occurred** (0.00m traveled). The Quadcopter session lacks a motion history file, suggesting incomplete data capture. Session naming follows a structured `YYYYMMDDHHMM-SessionName` format.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Session Naming**: Generates standardized session IDs (e.g., `202512131942-Butterfly`).
- **Movement Verification**: Confirms drones receive updates but fail to execute physical movement.
- **Replay Mechanism**: Enables session replay via API or UI using session IDs.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Drone control API (`http://localhost:5007/api/sessions`), UI session selection dropdown.

### USAGE
To replay sessions, use the provided session IDs via API (e.g., `curl` command) or navigate to the UI session dropdown. Next steps involve debugging why drones aren’t moving, checking command transmission, and verifying motion pattern execution.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Session Naming**: Follow the `YYYYMMDDHHMM-SessionName` format for consistency. Example: `202512131942-Butterfly`.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Movement Issue**: Drones may not move due to missing commands, incorrect ML thrust calculations, or physics misconfigurations. Verify drone control logic before proceeding.
