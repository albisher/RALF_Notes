### SUMMARY
Migration plan for completing legacy system integration into a modular architecture, focusing on critical core components like Socket.IO, plots, and session management.

### DETAILS
This document outlines Phase 4 of a migration plan to transition a legacy system (~60% un-migrated) into a modular architecture. The plan is divided into four sub-phases (4A-4D), prioritizing critical and feature-specific components. Phase 4A targets core functionalities such as Socket.IO updates, plot initialization, and lifecycle management, ensuring real-time and session-dependent features are operational. The document details current state analysis, compliance checks for file size limits (≤500 lines), and risks like exceeding line limits in mixins. Mitigation strategies include splitting large mixins into sub-mixins.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **SessionState.js**: Manages session and replay state, including session lists, replay data, and playback controls.
- **Socket.IO updates**: Real-time bidirectional communication for core app functionality.
- **Plot initialization/rendering**: Visualization components for maps and data.
- **Lifecycle hooks**: Event triggers for app state transitions (e.g., onMount, onUnmount).

### DEPENDENCIES
- Universal Programming Skill framework (for modularization guidelines)
- Socket.IO library (for real-time updates)
- WebGL/Canvas libraries (for plot rendering)
- State management libraries (e.g., Vuex, Pinia, or custom modules)

### USAGE
To implement this plan:
1. **Phase 4A**: Focus on completing missing state modules (e.g., `SessionState.js`) and ensuring Socket.IO and plot modules adhere to modular patterns.
2. **Monitor line counts**: Split large mixins if exceeding 500 lines.
3. **Test incrementally**: Validate core features (e.g., real-time updates, session replay) after each sub-phase.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Critical Core Priority**: Phase 4A must restore Socket.IO and plot functionality *before* proceeding to feature-specific phases. Delaying core fixes risks breaking downstream dependencies (e.g., session management, GPS/map loading).
>
>[!WARNING]- Risk Mitigation
> **Line-Exceeding Mixins**: If a mixin (e.g., `VisualizationMixin`) exceeds 500 lines after migration, split it into sub-mixins (e.g., `PlotMixin`, `CameraMixin`) to comply with Universal Programming Skill constraints. This prevents code bloat and improves modularity.
