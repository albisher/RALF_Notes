### SUMMARY
Tracks UI/UX feedback and design iterations for a card-based timeline system, focusing on visual layout, workflow stages, and component-based architecture improvements.

### DETAILS
This file documents iterative feedback for a **card-based timeline UI system**, evolving from Iteration 04 through 07. It emphasizes **user interface refinements**, **color schemes**, and **component reuse** while maintaining consistency with prior design choices. The process includes **timeline improvements**, **world management systems**, and **responsive layout adjustments** for better usability. Architectural decisions focus on modular components and standardized styling (e.g., color schemas) to ensure maintainability.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Feedback Tracking**: Logs user preferences, design changes, and iteration decisions.
- **Timeline Card System**: Manages side/primary timelines, card selection, and visual feedback.
- **World Management**: Handles world conventions, time systems, and rules via a settings dialog.
- **Workflow Stages**: Dynamically updates UI columns based on selected stage (e.g., Generate, Link, Story).
- **CardViewer UI**: Production-ready card viewer (`cardview.html`) with embedded functionality.
- **Color Schema**: Centralized style documentation (`styles/color-schema.html`) for consistency.

### DEPENDENCIES
`ui-explorations/cardview-iterations/`, `ui-explorations/`, `box-components.js`, `styles/color-schema.html`, Obsidian notes for related design docs.

### USAGE
1. **Iteration Review**: Compare feedback across iterations (e.g., 04→05 vs. 06→07) to identify trends.
2. **Component Testing**: Use `cardview.html` for prototyping with embedded mode (`?embedded=true`).
3. **Architecture**: Apply component-based design (e.g., reusable boxes) and color schemas to new features.
4. **Documentation**: Reference `README.md` and `CARDVIEWER_DOCUMENTATION.md` for implementation details.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Version**
> The **`cardview.html`** (Iteration 6) is the stable production UI—all future iterations should embed this version. Avoid hardcoding changes unless explicitly approved by feedback iterations.
>[!WARNING]- **World Dialog Caution**
> World-related settings (e.g., time systems) were moved to a **settings dialog** (Iteration 6) to prevent clutter. Ensure new features integrate here, not as standalone UI elements.
