### SUMMARY
Tests deletion of a world from an API endpoint after authentication.

### DETAILS
This script uses Axios to interact with a local API running on `https://localhost:8443/api`. It first authenticates using a hardcoded test user (`test`/`passtest`), then retrieves a list of worlds. It selects a world (excluding "Space Peral") for deletion, sends a DELETE request, and verifies the deletion by checking if the world remains in the list. The script logs each step and handles errors, including server-side failures (e.g., 500 errors).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`authenticate()`**: Authenticates with the API using hardcoded credentials and returns an access token.
- **`testWorldDelete()`**: Orchestrates the full workflow: fetching worlds, selecting a test world, deleting it, and verifying deletion.

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `https` (Node.js built-in modules)

### USAGE
1. Run the script directly in a Node.js environment.
2. Ensure the API is running at `https://localhost:8443/api` with the expected endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/worlds`).
3. The script ignores SSL certificate errors for testing purposes.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `rejectUnauthorized: false` for HTTPS requests, which may expose it to security risks in production. Use this only for testing.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Hardcoded credentials (`test`/`passtest`) are insecure. Replace with environment variables or a secure config in production.
