### SUMMARY
Assessment of the HMRS Window Cleaning Drone Swarm project, highlighting its modular architecture, drone types, and technical capabilities, alongside critical Docker and runtime issues preventing operational use.

### DETAILS
This document evaluates the **Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System (HMRS)** for window cleaning drones, focusing on its **box-based microservices architecture** with 43 specialized components. The system includes four drone types (Scout, Overseer, Tanker-Mule, Tanker-Lifeline) and integrates vendor-specific drones (DJI/Parrot) via adapters. The architecture leverages **PyBullet for physics simulation**, **Flask-Socket.IO for real-time web visualization**, and a **PostgreSQL session database**. The project is **production-ready in simulation** but faces **Docker deployment failures** (missing containers, misconfigured paths) and lacks operational examples.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **hmrs_simulation_live.py**: Core simulation engine managing drone swarm dynamics and window cleaning logic.
- **Backend Container (Flask + Socket.IO)**: Handles REST API endpoints and real-time updates (30-50ms latency) via `/api/` and `/socket.io/` routes.
- **Frontend Container (Nginx)**: Serves static files and proxies requests to the backend.
- **Session DB (PostgreSQL)**: Stores session persistence, command history, and drone configurations.
- **Vendor Adapter System**: Enables compatibility with DJI and Parrot drones through standardized interfaces.

### DEPENDENCIES
- Docker Compose (for multi-container deployment)
- PyBullet (physics engine)
- Flask (backend framework)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Socket.IO (real-time communication)
- Nginx (frontend proxy)
- Plotly (visualization library)

### USAGE
To operate the system, users must:
1. Navigate to the `docker/` subdirectory and run `docker-compose up -d` to launch containers.
2. Access the frontend via `http://localhost:5007` (default port).
3. Use the REST API (`/api/`) or Socket.IO (`/socket.io/`) for drone commands.
4. Ensure PostgreSQL is running at `localhost:5432` for session persistence.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Docker Dependency
> The `docker/` subdirectory contains the `docker-compose.yml` file, which must be executed from its root directory to deploy all containers. Missteps here (e.g., incorrect path) cause container failures.
>[!WARNING]- Real-Time Latency
> Socket.IO latency (~30-50ms) may introduce minor delays in drone coordination. For critical applications, test latency under load conditions.
>[!INFO]- Drone Type Specialization
> Each drone type (e.g., Tanker-Mule) has unique behaviors. The `hmrs_simulation_live.py` module dynamically assigns roles based on drone capabilities, but manual overrides may be needed for custom workflows.
