### SUMMARY
A ground-based observer camera class for tracking drones in a swarm using PyBullet physics simulation.

### DETAILS
The `ObserverCamera` class extends `BaseDrone` to create a stationary or mobile ground-based camera that observes drone swarm positions. It initializes with configurable FOV (60°), max observation range (50m), and orientation parameters (pitch -45°, yaw 0°). The `observe_swarm` method computes drone positions relative to the camera, checks if they fall within FOV and range, and returns structured observations including drone names, IDs, positions, velocities, and timestamps.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`__init__`**: Initializes the camera with PyBullet body ID, position, and observation parameters.
- **`observe_swarm`**: Processes a list of `BaseDrone` objects, calculates relative positions, applies FOV/range checks, and returns observations as a dictionary.

### DEPENDENCIES
numpy, pybullet, `.base_drone` (custom module)

### USAGE
```python
camera = ObserverCamera(camera_id=1, position=(0, 0, 0), physics_client=physics_client)
drones = [drone1, drone2]  # List of BaseDrone objects
observations = camera.observe_swarm(drones)
```

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Field of View (FOV) Limitation
> The FOV check is simplified and assumes a vertical cone centered on the camera's pitch angle. For precise tracking, consider implementing a more sophisticated FOV model (e.g., using trigonometric constraints for horizontal/vertical limits).
>[!WARNING]- Distance Threshold
> If `max_range` is exceeded, drones are silently dropped from observations. Ensure the camera’s range is dynamically adjusted based on swarm density to avoid data loss.
