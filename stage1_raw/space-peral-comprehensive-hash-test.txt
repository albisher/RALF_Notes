### SUMMARY
Automated Puppeteer test suite for verifying hash and asset creation features in Space Peral’s Writing Workspace.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to automate browser interactions with Space Peral’s application, focusing on:
1. Launching a headless browser with security bypass flags.
2. Logging in (if required) and navigating to the Writing Workspace.
3. Testing asset creation workflows and hash validation for different asset types.
4. Capturing screenshots at key stages for debugging/verification.

The test logs progress via `console.log` and captures screenshots of critical pages (initial login, workspace, and asset creator UI). It also monitors network requests and console errors for debugging.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`testSpacePeralComprehensiveHashFeatures()`**: Main async function orchestrating the entire test workflow.
- **`puppeteer.launch()`**: Configures and starts a headless Chrome browser with security overrides.
- **`page.evaluateHandle()`**: Executes JavaScript in the browser context to locate UI elements dynamically.
- **`page.screenshot()`**: Captures full-page screenshots at predefined steps.
- **`page.on('request')`/`page.on('console')`**: Listens for API calls and error logs for debugging.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node space-peral-comprehensive-hash-test.js`.
3. Ensure Space Peral is running locally at `https://localhost:8443/` with credentials (`test`/`passtest`).
4. Outputs screenshots in `checks/screenshots/` and logs progress to console.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script uses `--disable-web-security` and ignores HTTPS errors for local testing. **Do not use this in production** without proper security hardening.
>
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Hardcoded credentials (`test`/`passtest`) may expose the application to unauthorized access. **Use environment variables** for production use.
