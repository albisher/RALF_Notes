### SUMMARY
Fixed critical JavaScript syntax errors in frontend data handling to resolve interface loading failures.

### DETAILS
The file contained structural syntax issues preventing proper execution, including unclosed braces, missing `async` keywords, and improper try-catch blocks. Fixes addressed parser errors by ensuring all function blocks, control structures, and asynchronous operations were syntactically complete. Validation confirmed all errors were resolved before deployment.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **initializeOSMViewsForLayout**: Fixed missing closing brace at line 2291.
- **applyZoom3D**: Closed function body properly at line 3078.
- **initPlot3D**: Added `async` keyword at line 8075.
- **initPlot2D**: Added `async` keyword at line 8377.
- **Try block in error handling**: Added matching try-catch for orphaned catch at line 8130.

### DEPENDENCIES
Node.js runtime environment, Plotly/Plot3DBox libraries (for visualization functions).

### USAGE
Apply these fixes by replacing the problematic code snippets in `/simulation/frontend/app-data.js` with the corrected versions. Re-run the application to validate syntax correctness.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> All fixes were validated with `node -c app-data.js` to ensure syntax compliance. Critical functions (`initPlot3D`, `initPlot2D`) now properly support `await` due to added `async` keywords.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Backward compatibility is maintained for deprecated `initPlot2D` via `plot2DBox` wrapper, but ensure all dependent code accounts for the transition.
