### DETAILS
This file outlines a comprehensive list of **internal and external conflicts** that can drive dramatic tension in storytelling. It categorizes common narrative struggles, such as **identity crises, power dynamics, and moral dilemmas**, to help writers craft compelling character arcs. The themes emphasize psychological depth, ethical challenges, and systemic obstacles that characters face, often intersecting with broader plot conflicts.

The list spans **personal struggles (e.g., fear of failure, isolation)** to **relationship-based conflicts (e.g., betrayal, conflicting loyalties)** and **environmental/societal pressures (e.g., loss of purpose, environmental challenges)**. These themes are foundational for creating relatable, conflict-rich narratives.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Core Insight**

>[!WARNING]- **Avoid Overuse**
> While rich, excessive conflicts can dilute character focus. Balance internal/external struggles to maintain narrative cohesion.
