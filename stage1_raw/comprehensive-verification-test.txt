### SUMMARY
Automated comprehensive verification of a web application using HTTP and Puppeteer for frontend validation.

### DETAILS
This script performs a multi-faceted verification of a web application running on `localhost:8443`. It first checks HTTP endpoints for correct status codes and content, then uses Puppeteer to validate frontend elements like the sidebar, page content, navigation, and icons. The test creates a screenshots directory for capturing visual outputs during execution.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`init()`**: Creates the screenshots directory if it doesn’t exist.
- **`verifyHTTPEndpoints()`**: Tests HTTP endpoints for correct responses (200 status) and logs results.
- **`makeHTTPRequest()`**: Helper function to make HTTP GET requests with timeout handling.
- **`verifyWithPuppeteer()`**: Launches a headless browser, navigates to the app, and checks DOM elements, content loading, and UI components.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, https, fs, path

### USAGE
1. Install dependencies (`npm install puppeteer`).
2. Run the script (`node comprehensive-verification-test.js`).
3. Verify results in console output and screenshots directory.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes the app runs on `localhost:8443` and uses HTTPS with insecure certificate handling (due to `rejectUnauthorized: false`). For production, adjust SSL settings or use a valid certificate.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless browser launch may take time (30s timeout). Increase `timeout` if the app is slow to respond.
