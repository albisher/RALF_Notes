### SUMMARY
Automated frontend validation script using Puppeteer to test and verify fixes in a web application.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to launch a headless browser and navigate through multiple frontend pages (dashboard, worlds, characters, elements) of a local web application running on `http://localhost:5173`. It logs console messages, checks for page errors, and evaluates the presence of any `window.errors` array to detect unresolved issues. The test runs sequentially, waiting for network idle states between page loads to ensure stability. Errors are captured and returned for analysis after all pages are visited.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testFrontendFixes()**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including browser launch, page navigation, error checking, and cleanup.
- **puppeteer.launch()**: Initializes a headless browser with customizable settings (headless mode, viewport, and security flags).
- **page.goto()**: Navigates to specified URLs with timeout and network idle wait conditions.
- **page.on('console')**: Captures and logs browser console messages for debugging.
- **page.on('pageerror')**: Logs any page-related errors encountered during execution.
- **page.evaluate()**: Executes JavaScript in the browser context to check for `window.errors` array.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node test-frontend-fixes.js`.
3. The script will automatically:
   - Launch a browser and navigate through the frontend pages.
   - Log console messages and errors.
   - Check for unresolved issues via `window.errors`.
   - Return a success/failure status with error count.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> This script assumes the frontend application is running locally on `http://localhost:5173`. If the app is deployed elsewhere, update the URLs accordingly.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Running Puppeteer in headless mode with `--no-sandbox` may expose security risks if misconfigured. Ensure the target environment is trusted.
