### SUMMARY
Defines system requirements for tracking view status and logging commands to ensure real-time monitoring and debugging.

### DETAILS
This document specifies the functional requirements for a system that continuously monitors viewer states (Cesium and Plotly) and logs all commands sent to and received from system components. It details state definitions (Ready, Error, Not Initialized, Not Available) and mandates logging of command execution and responses at an INFO level for visibility in the `/sm/` dashboard.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracks viewer initialization, errors, and availability across Cesium and Plotly viewers.
- **Command Logging**: Logs all commands sent to Cesium (`OSMIntegrationBox`) and Plotly (`Plot3DBox`, `Plot2DBox`) boxes at INFO level.
- **Response Logging**: Captures command execution outcomes (success/failure) with metadata like timestamp, command type, and target.
- **State Transition Logging**: Records state changes (e.g., `Ready`, `Error`) for each viewer instance.

### DEPENDENCIES
`system-monitoring-box.js`, Cesium 2D/3D viewers, Plotly 2D/3D viewers, Docker Compose, `/api/simulation`, `/api/master-controls`, `/api/drones`, `/api/command` endpoints.

### USAGE
1. **Monitoring**: Use the `system-monitoring-box.js` to check viewer states dynamically.
2. **Logging**: Ensure all commands (e.g., `initViewer`, `updatePlot`) are logged at INFO level in `/sm/`.
3. **Testing**: Execute the test flow (Docker Compose, API calls) to verify logging accuracy for commands and responses.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Logging must be at INFO level to ensure visibility in `/sm/`. Debug logs are deprecated for clarity.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Delayed response logging (10ms) simulates async behavior but should not affect critical command validation. Ensure real-world delays are accounted for in production.
