### SUMMARY
Document outlines system logging implementation for verifying view initialization across different layout modes.

### DETAILS
This document details the verification process for logging view initialization checks in a system supporting multiple layout modes (Quad, 3D Only, 2D Only, OSM). It specifies expected log messages and data structures, including layout mode, check details (view name, type, readiness), and overall readiness status. Manual verification steps are provided for each layout mode to confirm correct logging behavior.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`Quad View Checks Complete`**: Logs completion of 4 checks (2D Top, 2D Front, 2D Side, 3D Isometric).
- **`3D Only View Check Complete`**: Logs completion of 1 check (3D Isometric).
- **`2D Only View Check Complete`**: Logs completion of 1 check (2D Top).
- **`OSM View Checks Complete`**: Logs completion of 2 checks (2D Top OSM, 3D Isometric OSM).
- **`allReady`**: Boolean flag indicating if all views in a layout mode are initialized.

### DEPENDENCIES
`MainAppData` (core application data handler for logging checks), Logs Sidebar UI component (for displaying logs).

### USAGE
1. Navigate to the application (`http://localhost:5000`).
2. Open the logs sidebar.
3. Trigger layout mode switches (Quad, 3D Only, 2D Only, OSM).
4. Verify log messages match expected patterns (e.g., "Quad View Checks Complete") and include correct check details.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Expected Log Structure
> Logs should include:
> - `layoutMode`: Current layout mode (e.g., "Quad").
> - `checks`: Array of objects with `view`, `ready`, and `container` properties.
> - `allReady`: Boolean (true if all views initialized).

>[!WARNING]- OSM Delay
> OSM views take longer to initialize (2-3 seconds). Ensure logs reflect this delay without false readiness claims.
