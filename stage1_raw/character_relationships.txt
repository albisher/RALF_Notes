### SUMMARY
Lists predefined character relationship categories for roleplaying or narrative design.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates distinct relationship types between characters, categorized by emotional, functional, or adversarial bonds. Relationships range from **loyalty-based** (e.g., *friend, mentor*) to **power dynamics** (e.g., *leader, follower*) and **conflictual** (e.g., *rival, adversary*). The list includes familial, romantic, and professional roles, useful for structuring dialogue, quests, or faction systems in games or storytelling.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Relationship Enumeration**: Core function to define character bonds programmatically (e.g., for AI or NPC logic).
- **Narrative Framework**: Provides a template for dynamic relationship systems (e.g., *partner → shared goals, enemy → conflict*).
- **Roleplay Tool**: Predefined labels for character interactions in tabletop games or writing.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
1. **Embed in Systems**: Integrate into game engines (e.g., Unity/Unreal) or narrative tools (e.g., Twine) via JSON/XML or direct lookup.
2. **Dialogue/Quest Design**: Assign relationships to NPCs to influence dialogue options or story progression.
3. **AI Behavior**: Use as input for procedural character AI (e.g., *teacher → student mentorship rules*).

> These terms can be extended with attributes (e.g., *Loyalty Level: High/Medium/Low*) or modifiers (e.g., *Rival → Secret Rivalry*).
>[!WARNING]- **Overlap Avoidance**
