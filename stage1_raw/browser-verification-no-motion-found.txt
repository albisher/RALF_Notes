### SUMMARY
Investigation into why a drone remains stationary despite processed `move_to` commands in a simulation environment.

### DETAILS
This document records a browser-based verification of a drone simulation where the drone (`TestDrone1`) is spawned at (0, 0, 5) but fails to move to the target position (10, 10, 10) despite commands being accepted and processed. The simulation logs show successful command queueing and processing, but the drone’s position remains unchanged. Key findings include potential issues with thrust computation, physics engine responsiveness, or command mode persistence. Debugging steps focus on logging thrust calculations, verifying thrust application, and testing direct RC control.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`receive_command()`**: Sets `command_mode` to `'move_to'` after processing a `move_to` command.
- **`RC Translator`**: Computes thrust values for drone movement (likely in `BaseDrone`).
- **`apply_thrust()`**: Applies computed thrusts to the drone (likely in PyBullet physics engine).
- **`move_to` command queue**: Processes and removes commands from the queue after acceptance.

### DEPENDENCIES
PyBullet (physics engine), Socket.IO (for command communication), BaseDrone class (contains RC translator logic).

### USAGE
This document is a troubleshooting log for verifying drone movement in a simulation. It outlines steps to diagnose why commands are processed but not executed, including debugging thrust computation and physics application.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Command Processing Flow**
> The `move_to` command is accepted, processed, and removed from the queue, but `receive_command()` does not trigger visible movement. Verify if `command_mode` persists across command cycles.

>[!WARNING]- **Physics Engine Dependency**
> If thrusts are computed but not applied, the drone may remain stationary. Check `PyBullet` force application and ensure `apply_thrust()` is called correctly.
