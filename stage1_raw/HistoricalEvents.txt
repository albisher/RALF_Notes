### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Impact
> Events like the **Great Resource Collapse** often trigger cascading crises (e.g., societal collapse, black markets), making them critical for plot development.
>[!WARNING]- Avoid Overlap
> Ensure no two events share identical timelines or outcomes to maintain narrative cohesion (e.g., the **Space Race** should precede the **X-Series Settlement**).
