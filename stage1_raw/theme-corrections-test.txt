### SUMMARY
Validates and logs theme color adjustments for a web application’s light/dark mode UI.

### DETAILS
This script uses `axios` to fetch a running application at `localhost:8443` with a bypassed HTTPS validation agent. It verifies theme corrections by comparing UI elements (backgrounds, sidebars, cards) against a predefined `colors.txt` specification. The test logs manual steps, expected changes, and technical fixes applied to ensure consistency between light/dark themes. It specifically checks UI classes (`v-main`, sidebar) and color transitions (e.g., `slate-50` → `slate-950`).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testThemeCorrections()**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including API calls, manual steps, and error handling.
- **axios.get()**: Fetches the application endpoint with a custom HTTPS agent to bypass SSL validation.
- **Console logging**: Records test progress, expected/actual results, and technical corrections.

### DEPENDENCIES
`axios`, `node:https` (for HTTPS agent creation)

### USAGE
1. Run the script in a Node.js environment.
2. Ensure the target application (`localhost:8443`) is running and accessible.
3. Verify the UI matches the logged `colors.txt` specifications after execution.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The test assumes `colors.txt` exists and defines exact color mappings for light/dark themes. Hardcoded values like `slate-50`/`slate-950` are referenced directly in the script.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Disabling SSL validation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) may expose the app to security risks in production. Use only for testing.
