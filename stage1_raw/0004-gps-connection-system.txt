### SUMMARY
A GPS-based drone connection and preflight testing system for autonomous worker drones, ensuring precise positioning and mission readiness before execution.

### DETAILS
This system integrates GPS tracking, connection management, and preflight validation for drones. Workers use high-precision GPS trackers (1cm accuracy) to report position, satellite status, and fix quality. The master node processes data, enforces immobility until connection and preflight completion, and enables mission execution only after all drones pass tests. The architecture includes three phases: connection, preflight testing (hover validation at 1m altitude), and mission execution. Data flows via structured JSON payloads containing positional, satellite, and connection status metrics.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`gps_tracker.py`**: Handles real-time GPS data collection with RTK-like precision, reporting fix quality, satellite count, and HDOP.
- **Worker Drones**: Act as autonomous nodes with GPS feedback, enforcing immobility until preflight passes, and learning positions via GPS corrections.
- **Ground Master Processing**: Aggregates GPS data from all workers, validates preflight tests (hover accuracy), and manages mission phase transitions.
- **Mission Phases Logic**: Enforces sequential execution (connection → preflight → mission) with immobility checks post-phase.

### DEPENDENCIES
Python libraries (simulated): `gpslib`, `rtk_simulator`, `drone-control`, `network-monitor` (custom modules for GPS parsing, drone control, and master coordination).

### USAGE
1. **Initialization**: Workers connect to the master via GPS port (5005).
2. **Phase 1**: Workers report position/satellite status; master validates all connections.
3. **Phase 2**: Master sends hover tests; workers report actual vs target height (1m).
4. **Phase 3**: Mission executes only if all drones pass preflight (error < 0.05m).
5. **Continuous Data**: GPS data streams persistently during mission execution.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Accuracy Requirement**
> Workers must achieve **RTK_FIX** with ≤0.05m error to proceed past connection phase. Non-compliant drones are locked until corrected.
>[!WARNING]- **Preflight Failures**
> Repeated hover test failures (>2 attempts) trigger manual override for the drone, preventing mission execution.
