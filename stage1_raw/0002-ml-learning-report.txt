### SUMMARY
Analyzes 5 simulation sessions of a machine learning system’s learned behaviors, focusing on decision-making patterns, performance metrics, and feature recognition.

### DETAILS
This report documents the findings of a machine learning system after five simulation sessions. The system exhibits **no adaptive learning**—it consistently applies rigid strategies (e.g., random target selection, first-available scout allocation) without optimizing resource allocation or improving mission outcomes. Key observations include:
- **No mission success** (0% success rate), as scouts fail to execute tasks.
- **Static decision-making** (e.g., fixed scout-to-building ratios) rather than dynamic adaptation.
- **Limited feature utilization** (e.g., building height/distance ignored for decisions).
- **Minimal command efficiency** (8 total commands across sessions, mostly redundant).

The system collects data but fails to derive meaningful patterns from failures, indicating a lack of reinforcement learning or optimization.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Target Selection Strategy**: Randomly assigns buildings without prioritization.
- **Scout Allocation Strategy**: Uses a simple "first-available" heuristic.
- **Mission Execution**: Sends commands but fails to achieve goals (e.g., no buildings scouted).
- **Feature Recognition**: Tracks variables (building height, scout count) but ignores them for decisions.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone simulation analysis report).

### USAGE
This report is for evaluating ML system performance in simulations, identifying gaps in adaptive learning and decision-making logic.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Key Insight
> The system’s **lack of optimization** suggests a failure in reinforcement learning—it repeats strategies instead of improving based on outcomes.
>[!WARNING]- Critical Limitation
> **No mission success** (0%) implies flawed execution logic, likely due to unlearned task-specific patterns (e.g., scout movement, target engagement).
