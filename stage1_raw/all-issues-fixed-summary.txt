### SUMMARY
Summary of resolved issues in motion history and session management systems, requiring server restart for full functionality.

### DETAILS
This document details fixes for five critical issues in a simulation system (`hmrs_simulation_live.py` and `create_replayable_session.py`), primarily addressing path resolution, debugging, and session creation. The core logic involves ensuring motion history files are correctly resolved, logged, and saved. The server restart is mandatory to load new debug configurations and resolve path-related dependencies. The fixes enhance troubleshooting for motion history loading and ensure session creation scripts reliably accumulate data before replay.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py` (lines 130-131, 3550-3562, 4738-4759)**: Handles path resolution, debug logging, and motion history validation.
- **`simulation/create_replayable_session.py`**: Validates simulation state, waits for motion accumulation, and monitors session progress.
- **`simulation/frontend/components/header-component.js`**: Implements search functionality for session dropdowns.

### DEPENDENCIES
`Path` (Python standard library), `curl` (command-line tool), `json` (Python standard library), `frontend` UI components (React-based).

### USAGE
1. **Apply fixes** to `simulation/hmrs_simulation_live.py` and `create_replayable_session.py`.
2. **Restart server** to load debug logs and resolve path issues.
3. **Test** with `curl` to verify motion history and replay availability, then validate UI playback.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Motion history debugging logs (lines 3550-3562) now identify loading failures, aiding diagnostics.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Server restart is required to load absolute paths and debug configurations; incomplete restarts may leave motion history unresolved.
