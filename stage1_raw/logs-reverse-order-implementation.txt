### SUMMARY
Modifies log ordering in a frontend application to display latest logs first in normal mode, preserving chronological order in time-travel replay mode.

### DETAILS
This implementation dynamically adjusts the order of logs in a sidebar based on the application's mode. When in **normal mode**, logs are sorted by `sim_time` in descending order (latest first), ensuring users can quickly view recent activity. In **time-travel mode**, logs revert to chronological order (oldest first) to maintain proper replay sequence. The change is encapsulated in a computed property (`filteredLogs`) that filters and sorts logs conditionally, ensuring backward compatibility with existing functionality.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`filteredLogs()`**: Computed property that returns filtered and sorted logs based on mode.
  - Filters logs by `currentTime` when in time travel mode.
  - Sorts logs in descending order (latest-first) in normal mode.
  - Sorts logs in ascending order (oldest-first) in time travel mode.
- **`sim_time`**: Log entry timestamp field used for sorting.
- **`timeTravelMode`**: Application state flag determining sorting logic.

### DEPENDENCIES
`communicationLog` (internal data store), `currentTime` (time-travel reference), `timeTravelMode` (mode flag).

### USAGE
1. **Normal Mode**: Logs appear in reverse chronological order (latest at top).
2. **Time Travel Mode**: Logs appear in chronological order (oldest at top) after filtering by `currentTime`.
   - Requires `timeTravelMode` and `currentTime` to be set.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Conditional Sorting Logic
> The function dynamically switches between ascending and descending sort based on `timeTravelMode`. This ensures correct behavior for both live monitoring and replay scenarios.
>[!WARNING]- Edge Case Handling
> Fallback (`|| 0`) for missing `sim_time` prevents runtime errors when sorting. Ensure all logs have a valid `sim_time` for accurate results.
