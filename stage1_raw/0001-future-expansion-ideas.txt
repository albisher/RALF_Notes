### SUMMARY
Explores future drone customization features for modular, mission-specific drone configurations.

### DETAILS
This document outlines a future expansion for a drone system, focusing on a **customizable chassis and addon interface** to support varied mission roles (scouting, tanking, overseeing). The plan includes selecting base platforms, configuring hardware addons (e.g., sensors, cameras), and managing configurations via a UI. Key features include drag-and-drop selection, real-time calculations (weight/power), and compatibility validation. The system leverages existing modular architecture and plans to transition to a database/JSON-based configuration system later.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`addon_configurator.py`**: Handles configuration management for drone addons.
- **Chassis Selection**: Defines base platforms (Scout, Tanker, Overseer, Custom).
- **Addon Compatibility Validation**: Ensures hardware combinations work together.
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Computes weight, power, and flight time dynamically.

### DEPENDENCIES
`addon_configurator.py`, modular drone hardware libraries, ROS2/MAVLink/DDS frameworks (if applicable).

### USAGE
1. Select a chassis (e.g., Scout) and configure addons (e.g., LiDAR, cameras).
2. Use drag-and-drop to preview and validate configurations.
3. Save/load configurations for simulations or real-world deployment.
4. Extend with future hardware via modular updates.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Modular Design
> The system prioritizes modularity to simplify future hardware additions. Existing addons are already compatible with this architecture.
>[!WARNING]- Validation Overhead
> Real-time compatibility checks may introduce minor latency; optimize later for performance-critical missions.
