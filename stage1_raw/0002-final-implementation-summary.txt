### SUMMARY
Final implementation of a drone learning system with ML-based autonomous navigation, scenario generation, and real-time performance tracking.

### DETAILS
This implementation integrates a **neural network-based ML controller** for drone navigation, generating randomized scenarios to train the system. The system captures screenshots of each scenario in organized folders, tracks success/failure metrics, and visualizes learning progress via a live dashboard. It includes a **weather system** affecting drone performance, realistic physics, and automated mission tasks. Continuous learning occurs in a containerized environment, with drones spawning periodically to test updated models.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **ML Controller (Neural Network)**: Learns from drone successes (architecture: 12→16→4 neurons).
- **Scenario Generator**: Creates random positions, motor states, and orientations for training.
- **Screenshot System**: Automatically captures scenario outcomes with success/failure labels.
- **Live Learning Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of drone performance (6-panel display).
- **Weather System**: Simulates 6 wind conditions (calm to storm) with dynamic effects on drone flight.
- **Mission Task Sequencer**: Automatically assigns and tracks drone tasks (e.g., air/water jets, cleaning).
- **Vision Drone Observer**: Monitors worker drones for task completion and quality assessment.
- **Base Master**: Aggregates observations and confirms task completion via drone data.

### DEPENDENCIES
PyBullet (physics engine), TensorFlow/PyTorch (neural network), custom drone simulation framework, containerized ML training environment.

### USAGE
1. **Run Simulation**: Launch drones with randomized scenarios (e.g., base→building→base).
2. **Monitor Learning**: Access live dashboard (port 5005) for real-time metrics.
3. **Analyze Data**: Review organized screenshots and daily summaries in `simulation_output/`.
4. **Adjust Weather**: Modify wind conditions to test robustness.
5. **Trigger Tasks**: Assign drone missions (e.g., cleaning, debris removal) via task sequencer.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Real-Time Container Learning**
> The system continuously updates the ML model in a Docker container, ensuring drones use the latest neural network weights during live operation. This requires seamless inter-process communication between the simulation and containerized training loop.
>[!WARNING]- **Physics-Sensor Tradeoff**
> Sensor noise (e.g., 1cm GPS accuracy) introduces variability in training data. Overly strict success criteria may lead to underfitting; balance accuracy and robustness in scenario design.
