### SUMMARY
Generates 95 unique cards programmatically via backend API using predefined categories, adjectives, and nouns.

### DETAILS
This script programmatically creates 95 unique cards by combining random adjectives, nouns, and predefined card subtypes (e.g., "tree," "temple") from structured data arrays (`CARD_TYPES`, `ADJECTIVES`, `NOUNS`). It first authenticates with a backend API, selects or creates a world, then iterates to generate each card with metadata like `power_level`, `rarity`, and `chapter`. The `generateHash` function ensures uniqueness via timestamp and randomness. The script logs success/failure for each card creation and tracks progress.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **login**: Authenticates with the backend API using provided credentials.
- **getOrCreateWorld**: Finds or creates a world (defaulting to "Zephyros Prime" or a new world named "Story World - 95 Cards").
- **createCard**: Sends a POST request to the backend API to create a single card with structured payload.
- **create95Cards**: Orchestrates the full process: authentication, world setup, and iterative card generation (95 total), with error handling and progress tracking.
- **getRandomElement**: Helper to randomly select an element from an array.
- **generateHash**: Generates a unique identifier for each card using timestamp, index, and randomness.

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, process.env (Node.js environment variables)

### USAGE
1. Set `BACKEND_URL`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` in environment variables or override defaults.
2. Run the script to authenticate, create a world, and generate 95 cards programmatically.
3. Cards are stored in the backend API under the selected world.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Authentication Fallback
> If environment variables are not set, defaults (`USERNAME: 'a'`, `PASSWORD: 'spq8'`) are used. Hardcoded credentials are insecure; use environment variables in production.
>[!WARNING]- Backend Dependency
> The script assumes the backend API exists at `http://localhost:5000` and supports `/api/auth/login`, `/api/worlds`, and `/api/cards` endpoints. Verify API compatibility before use.
