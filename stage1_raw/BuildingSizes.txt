### SUMMARY
Defines a set of size categories for building or structure classification.

### DETAILS
This file enumerates descriptive terms representing different scales of building sizes, likely used for categorization in architectural, spatial, or simulation contexts. The terms are grouped into standalone sizes (e.g., `tiny`, `large`) and combined categories (e.g., `sprawling, village-like`), suggesting a hierarchical or hybrid classification system.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Size Classification**: Assigns descriptive labels to building dimensions or spatial configurations.
- **Hierarchical Grouping**: Combines related terms (e.g., `sprawling` and `village-like`) for broader categorization.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
This list is likely used as input for algorithms, databases, or systems requiring structured size categorization. Example applications include:
- **Game Development**: Assigning building types in procedural generation.
- **Urban Planning**: Defining spatial zones or architectural constraints.
- **Simulation Tools**: Classifying structures for dynamic modeling.

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Contextual Use
> These terms may be paired with numerical thresholds (e.g., square footage, height) to refine classification logic.
>[!WARNING]- Ambiguity Risk
> Terms like `sprawling, village-like` could overlap; ensure distinct criteria for differentiation in implementation.
