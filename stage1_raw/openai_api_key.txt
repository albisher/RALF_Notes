### SUMMARY
Stores an OpenAI API key for authentication in API interactions.

### DETAILS
This file contains a placeholder for an OpenAI API key, which is required for accessing OpenAI’s services (e.g., text generation, model inference). The key is typically stored securely in environment variables or configuration files to avoid hardcoding sensitive data. This file likely serves as a reference or template for where the key should be inserted during setup.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`openai_api_key`**: Stores the API key for authentication with OpenAI’s API.
  *(Note: This is a literal placeholder string; actual usage would involve loading this value dynamically.)*

### DEPENDENCIES
none (unless integrated into a larger system requiring environment variables or libraries like `python-dotenv`)

### USAGE
1. Replace `your-openai-api-key-here` with the actual OpenAI API key.
2. Securely manage the key (e.g., via `.env` files, environment variables, or secrets managers).
3. Integrate the key into applications using libraries like `openai` (Python) or `axios` (JavaScript).

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!WARNING]- Security Risk
> Hardcoding API keys in files (even placeholders) can expose credentials if the file is accidentally committed to version control or accessed by unauthorized users. Always use secure storage methods (e.g., environment variables, secrets managers).
>[!INFO]- Best Practice
> For production use, avoid storing keys in plaintext files. Use tools like `python-dotenv` (Python) or `dotenv` (Node.js) to load keys from external files. Example:
> ```python
> from dotenv import load_dotenv
> load_dotenv()  # Loads from .env file
> ```
