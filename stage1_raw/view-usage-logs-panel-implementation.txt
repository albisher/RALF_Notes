### SUMMARY
Implements a dedicated "View & Usage Logs" panel for tracking and filtering visualization interaction logs in a system monitoring dashboard.

### DETAILS
This implementation adds a fifth column to the system monitoring page’s main content grid, hosting a new panel for view and usage logs. The panel dynamically filters logs based on predefined criteria (e.g., log types like `view_check`, `plotly_command`, and source-specific exclusions like OSM logs). It includes interactive features like clearing logs, exporting to JSON, and expandable details for full log inspection. The design uses a cyan/teal color scheme to visually distinguish it from other panels.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`viewUsageLogs()`**: Computed property filtering logs by type, source, and keywords.
- **`clearViewUsageLogs()`**: Removes view/usage logs from storage (`window.loggingBox.logHistory` and `systemLogs`).
- **`exportViewUsageLogs(format)`**: Exports filtered logs to JSON with a timestamped filename.
- **Panel Header**: Displays log count, clear/export buttons, and a title icon (👁️).

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation/frontend/pages/system-monitoring-page-component.js`, Plotly/Cesium libraries (for log parsing), React/Vue-like framework (for UI rendering).

### USAGE
1. **Trigger**: User navigates to the System Monitoring page.
2. **Action**: The panel auto-populates with filtered logs (e.g., viewer initialization, plot updates).
3. **Interactions**:
   - Clear logs via the clear button.
   - Export logs via the export button (JSON format).
   - Expand logs to view full details.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Logs exclude OSM-specific entries (e.g., tile imagery) and prioritize view-related commands from `Plot2DBox`/`Plot3DBox`. Excluded logs are dynamically filtered out in `viewUsageLogs()`.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Clearing logs (`clearViewUsageLogs()`) permanently removes entries from both `window.loggingBox.logHistory` and the `systemLogs` array. Ensure logs are backed up before clearing.
