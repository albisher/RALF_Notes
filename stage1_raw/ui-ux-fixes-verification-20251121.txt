### SUMMARY
Fixes UI/UX layout issues in a three-column workflow system by adjusting CSS Grid column distribution for Link, Timeline, and Story stages.

### DETAILS
This report documents CSS modifications to resolve unequal column width distribution in a three-column layout across Link, Timeline, and Story stages. The original constraints (`minmax(300px, 1fr)` and `min-width: 300px`) prevented equal distribution, forcing uneven widths. The solution replaced these with `repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))` and removed arbitrary `min-width` constraints, enabling fluid, equal-width columns. Additional improvements included responsive adjustments for smaller viewports, accessibility compliance, and removal of animations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))`**: Forces equal distribution of three columns by allowing them to shrink to zero width.
- **`min-width: 0`**: Removes the fixed minimum width constraint on columns.
- **`max-width: 100%`**: Ensures columns respect container boundaries.
- **`column` class removal of `min-width: 250px`**: Prevents global constraints on column sizing.
- **Top Timeline adjustments**: Increased height to 150px and switched to flex layout for better visibility.

### DEPENDENCIES
`/Users/amac/Downloads/spq8/ui-beta/src/styles/workflow.css` (local CSS file), external UI/UX testing tools (e.g., browser dev tools for visual verification).

### USAGE
To apply these fixes:
1. Edit `/Users/amac/Downloads/spq8/ui-beta/src/styles/workflow.css` and update the CSS rules for `.link-stage`, `.timeline-stage`, `.story-stage`, and `.column` classes as shown.
2. Verify visually using screenshots or browser dev tools to confirm equal column widths (~33% each).
3. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window to ensure columns stack correctly on narrower screens.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Root Cause Analysis
> The original constraints (`minmax(300px, 1fr)` and `min-width: 300px`) enforced rigid column widths, breaking equal distribution when content or container size varied. The fix dynamically adjusts columns to fill available space equally.

>[!WARNING]- Future-Proofing
> While the current solution works for typical widths, consider adding media queries (e.g., `<900px`) to stack columns vertically on very narrow screens to avoid usability issues. Monitor content overflow in narrower columns during user testing.
