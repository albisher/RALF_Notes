### SUMMARY
Designs a timeline-first layout for organizing and navigating temporal/spatial data with interactive controls.

### DETAILS
This template organizes content around a **horizontal/vertical timeline**, prioritizing time-based navigation while supporting spatial relationships. The layout includes a **header with world/time controls**, a **collapsible tools sidebar**, and a **card details section** below the timeline. The design emphasizes **time-driven interactions**, such as zooming, panning, and clustering, with optional **map view** for spatial context. Responsive breakpoints adapt the UI for mobile, tablet, and desktop, ensuring usability across devices.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **World Selector (WS)**: Dropdown for world navigation with current world indicator and creation button.
- **Time Controls**: Current time display, navigation buttons, jump-to-date picker, range selector, and zoom controls.
- **Timeline**: Horizontal/vertical time axis with clickable markers, hover tooltips, and drag-to-pan/zoom interactions.
- **Card Details Section**: Displays selected card(s) with full metadata, images, and edit/delete options.
- **Tools Sidebar**: Collapsible panel with hash generation, card builder, and filters (time range, card type, location, tags).
- **Map View**: Optional spatial visualization of cards as markers with time slider overlay.
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Adapts UI layout for mobile (<768px), tablet (768–1024px), and desktop (>1024px) screens.

### DEPENDENCIES
React (for UI components), CSS/JS libraries (e.g., D3.js for timeline rendering, Bootstrap for responsive grid), and a backend API for world/time data.

### USAGE
1. **Initialize**: Load world/time data into the header and timeline components.
2. **Interact**:
   - Use the timeline to select cards by time.
   - Drag markers to adjust time or pan the timeline.
   - Click cards to view details or edit them.
   - Expand the sidebar for filters or tools.
3. **Responsive Adjustments**: Switch between vertical/horizontal timelines based on screen size.
4. **Map View**: Toggle between timeline and map for spatial context.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Primary Focus**
> This layout excels for **chronological storytelling** or **event tracking**, where time is the core dimension. Avoid if users need heavy creation tools (e.g., freeform content generation).

>[!WARNING]- **Complexity Warning**
> Timeline interactions (e.g., drag-to-pan, pinch-to-zoom) may confuse users unfamiliar with time-based navigation. Provide clear tooltips or tutorials for critical features.
