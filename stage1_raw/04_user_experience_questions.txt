### SUMMARY
Explores foundational UX questions for a content-generation system, covering UI, interaction, customization, and performance.

### DETAILS
This document outlines critical user experience considerations for a system designed to generate, visualize, and manage content. It addresses technical, functional, and usability aspects, such as platform choice, accessibility, real-time feedback, and error handling. The questions span interface design (e.g., responsive vs. desktop), user workflows (e.g., batch generation, presets), and content management (e.g., quotas, recommendations). The focus is on balancing usability, performance, and extensibility to ensure a seamless experience across devices and use cases.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **User Journey Mapping**: Defines core workflows (generate → view → customize → export).
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensures WCAG standards for all interfaces.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Prioritizes immediate user responses during generation.
- **Content Organization**: Structures user-generated content via profiles, presets, and quotas.
- **Error Handling**: Standardizes how failures are communicated and resolved.

### DEPENDENCIES
None (standalone UX research document).

### USAGE
This document serves as a blueprint for UX teams to align on requirements before development. It should be referenced during:
- UI/UX design sprints,
- Feature prioritization,
- Accessibility audits,
- Performance testing.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Priority
> Questions 5–8 (user journey and feedback) directly impact perceived efficiency—optimize these to reduce friction in core workflows.
>[!WARNING]- Compliance Risk
> Ignoring accessibility (Q4) or real-time feedback (Q7) may violate regulations (e.g., WCAG 2.1) or user expectations. Audit these early.
