### SUMMARY
Summary of critical UI/UX fixes for timeline navigation and WebSocket dropdown timeout in a web application.

### DETAILS
This document details the resolution of two critical UI/UX issues in a web application, verified via testing reports and live demonstrations. The fixes involved updating URL routing for timeline navigation and optimizing WebSocket handling in dropdown menus to prevent timeouts. Changes were made in Vue.js components (`WorkflowPage.vue` and `CreateWorldModal.vue`), ensuring backward compatibility and improving user experience.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`handleHashChange`**: Updated to support both `#timeline` and `#/timeline` URL formats in `WorkflowPage.vue`.
- **`switchStage`**: Modified to validate URL compatibility for timeline navigation.
- **`$nextTick` wrapper**: Applied to `onWorldTypeChange` in `CreateWorldModal.vue` to prevent blocking WebSocket timeouts.
- **`ui-beta/src/pages/WorkflowPage.vue`**: Core file for timeline navigation fixes.
- **`ui-beta/src/components/common/CreateWorldModal.vue`**: Core file for WebSocket optimization.

### DEPENDENCIES
Vue.js (for routing and event handling), WebSocket library (for dropdown interactions), React/Vue testing frameworks (for verification).

### USAGE
The fixes were applied via code updates in Vue components and verified through live testing on `http://localhost:5174/`. The application is now ready for production deployment after regression testing.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Critical Fixes Verified**
> Both timeline navigation and WebSocket dropdown issues were confirmed functional post-fix, with no regressions in existing features.
>
>[!WARNING]- **Next Steps Remaining**
> Modal close button, parent world dropdown, and JSON metadata validation still require testing per original report. Ensure these are addressed before full deployment.
