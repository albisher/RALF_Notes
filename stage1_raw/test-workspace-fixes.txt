### SUMMARY
Automated UI validation for a workspace application, checking time period selectors and asset details functionality.

### DETAILS
This script uses Puppeteer to automate browser interactions with a local workspace application (running on `http://localhost:5173/workspace`). It verifies the presence and functionality of time period selectors (e.g., Past/Present/Future, quick options like Dawn/Morning/Noon) and asset details panels. The test captures screenshots at key stages (initial load, dropdown interaction, time selection, and asset clicks) and logs validation results for debugging. It also checks for hidden errors like `[obj...]` in page content or dropdown options.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **testWorkspaceFixes**: Orchestrates the entire test workflow, including browser launch, navigation, and UI validation.
- **puppeteer.launch**: Configures a headless Chrome browser with security-disabling flags for stability.
- **page.goto**: Navigates to the workspace URL with timeout and DOM content loading checks.
- **page.screenshot**: Captures visual snapshots at critical test stages.
- **page.evaluate**: Extracts dynamic page content (e.g., body text, dropdown options) for validation.

### DEPENDENCIES
puppeteer, Node.js runtime

### USAGE
1. Install Puppeteer: `npm install puppeteer`.
2. Run the script: `node test-workspace-fixes.js`.
3. Ensure the workspace app is running locally at `http://localhost:5173/workspace`.
4. Outputs:
   - Console logs for validation results.
   - Screenshots in `checks/screenshots/` for debugging.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script disables security features (`--disable-web-security`) for testing, which may expose the app to risks in production. Use only in controlled environments.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> The `waitForTimeout` calls introduce delays; reduce them for faster execution if needed, but ensure UI elements are stable before validation.
