### SUMMARY
Analyzes 3D replay visualization test results for drone motion history, highlighting issues with static data and code functionality.

### DETAILS
This document evaluates a 3D replay visualization test for drone motion data, conducted on December 19, 2024. The test session (`202512141344-ReplayTest`) recorded motion history for three drones (`scout-1`, `scout-2`, `scout-3`), but all drones remained stationary at `[10.00, 10.00, 5.00]` with no movement detected. The code for 3D visualization is confirmed functional, but the motion data lacks actual movement, causing drones to appear stationary in the replay. The system records up to 200 motion points per drone and correctly structures data for visualization, though the lack of movement data requires a new session with active drone movement for proper testing.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`self.motion_history[drone_name]`**: Stores recorded drone position updates during simulation.
- **Replay endpoint**: Loads and processes session data for 3D visualization.
- **Time-based positioning**: Displays drone positions at specific timestamps in the UI.

### DEPENDENCIES
`drone-simulation-library`, `3d-visualization-engine`, `UI-framework` (local development environment components)

### USAGE
To test 3D replay:
1. Open UI at `http://localhost:5007`.
2. Select a session with recorded motion history.
3. Load the replay and verify drone positions in the 3D plot.
4. Use time controls to validate static/dynamic behavior.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> Motion history is recorded correctly but requires active drone movement to show real-time changes in the 3D replay. Static data will result in stationary drone visualization.

>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Test sessions with no movement may not reflect actual system performance. Always verify drone movement before replay testing.
