### SUMMARY
Document tracks fixes for avatar visibility and color/content research for UI/UX improvements in a creative writing tool.

### DETAILS
This file documents bug fixes and research findings related to user interface improvements. The primary issue addressed was the disappearance of user avatars in the sidebar due to conditional rendering logic. The solution involved removing conditional checks to ensure avatars always display, with a fallback placeholder. Additionally, comprehensive research was conducted on color psychology, stage-specific design recommendations, and content organization best practices, including accessibility standards and visual hierarchy principles.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`getUserDisplayName()`**: Handles all display logic for user profile elements.
- **`SidebarNavigation.vue`**: Component modified to ensure avatar visibility regardless of user data state.
- **`ui-ux-audits/20251121-color-content-research.md`**: Document containing findings on color psychology, stage-specific design, and content organization.

### DEPENDENCIES
Obsidian notes (`ui-ux-audits/` folder), Vue.js framework components, WCAG accessibility guidelines.

### USAGE
- Apply avatar fix by removing conditional rendering in `SidebarNavigation.vue`.
- Use research findings to implement stage-specific color schemes and content organization patterns.
- Ensure all text/background colors meet WCAG AA contrast ratios.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Avatar Fallback**
> The modified `SidebarNavigation.vue` now displays a "User" placeholder if no user data is available, ensuring consistent visibility.
>[!WARNING]- **Contrast Compliance**
> Verify all text/background colors meet WCAG AA standards (contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1) during implementation to avoid accessibility violations.
