### SUMMARY
This document analyzes the status of map generation enhancements, identifying why visual improvements (e.g., hillshading, biome diversity) are not executing despite functional creation of enhancement boxes.

### DETAILS
The document evaluates a map generation system where basic functionality (Voronoi cells, heightmaps) works correctly but enhancement boxes—designed to add visual features like rivers, mountains, and fractal edges—remain inactive. Root causes include a bypassed execution path in Quick Preview mode and silent import errors in Docker environments. Fixes applied include improved import path resolution and comprehensive logging, but execution still fails due to unintegrated backend logic.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Quick Preview generation path**: Skips enhancement boxes, using direct Python generators instead.
- **`map_generator.py`**: Contains enhancement box integration logic but is bypassed in Quick Preview.
- **API endpoints (`/generation/terrain`, `/generation/cells`, etc.)**: Call basic generators, excluding enhancements.
- **Enhancement boxes**: Created but never executed due to import path and execution flow issues.
- **Screenshots (e.g., `test-planet-001`)**: Visually confirm flat, angular maps with missing features.

### DEPENDENCIES
Docker containerized backend, Python-based map generation libraries, UI viewer framework, and enhancement box modules.

### USAGE
To verify fixes, generate a Full Map (not Quick Preview) and check backend logs for enhancement box execution. Test all world types systematically to ensure consistent results.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Quick Preview Bypass
> The `/generation/terrain` endpoint directly invokes basic generators, bypassing the enhancement pipeline in `map_generator.py`. This must be fixed by either integrating enhancements into the Quick Preview path or forcing it to use the full pipeline.
>[!WARNING]- Silent Failures
> Import errors in Docker are masked by try/except blocks, leading to undetected box failures. Comprehensive logging is critical to diagnose silent issues.
