### **SUMMARY**
Comprehensive UI feature verification checklist comparing visible elements to actual working functionality, highlighting discrepancies due to missing browser testing.

### **DETAILS**
This document serves as a **theoretical UI feature checklist** based on API testing and code inspection, but was later discovered to lack actual browser validation. It documents UI components (tabs, headers, sidebars) that users *should* see versus those that function correctly, revealing Vue component registration and dependency issues. The checklist was intended to validate frontend features against backend APIs but was flawed due to untested browser rendering.

### **KEY_FUNCTIONS**
- **Main Navigation Tabs**: Tab visibility and switching functionality.
- **Simulation View Header**: Status display and quick action buttons.
- **Status Section**: Real-time status updates via `/api/realtime-status`.
- **Sessions Section**: Session list, selection, and replay functionality.
- **Spawn Drone Section**: Drone spawning via `/api/spawn`.
- **Command Section**: Drone command selection.

### **DEPENDENCIES**
- Vue.js components (e.g., `confirmationDialog`).
- Backend API endpoints (`/api/realtime-status`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/spawn`).

### **USAGE**
This checklist was used to **compare frontend UI structure with backend API responses** before browser testing. Actual UI rendering issues were later identified during real-world testing.

### **CALLOUTS**
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> **Checklist was based on code inspection and API testing, not browser rendering.** Actual UI errors (e.g., `confirmationDialog` undefined) were only discovered post-testing.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> **Do not rely on this checklist for verified functionality.** Browser testing is mandatory to confirm UI behavior.
