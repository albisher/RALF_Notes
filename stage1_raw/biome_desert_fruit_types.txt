### SUMMARY
Describes fruit type classifications for desert biome plants, focusing on nuts and spiky clusters.

### DETAILS
This file appears to categorize fruit types found in desert biomes, specifically highlighting **Nuts** (both hard-shelled and soft-shelled) and **Spiky Clusters**. These adaptations likely serve to reduce water loss, deter herbivores, and facilitate seed dispersal in arid environments. The classification may relate to ecological studies or game mechanics (e.g., biome generation systems).

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Nuts (hard/soft-shelled)**: Seed-bearing fruits with protective shells, adapted for survival in deserts.
- **Spiky Clusters**: Aggregated fruits with thorny structures, aiding in seed dispersal and water conservation.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (standalone classification list)

### USAGE
This could be used in:
- **Biome generation systems** (e.g., procedural world-building).
- **Ecological modeling** (e.g., plant survival strategies).
- **Game design** (e.g., identifying plant types for desert environments).

### RELATED
none

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Adaptive Significance
> Spiky clusters and hard-shelled nuts are common in desert plants due to their role in **reducing water loss** and **preventing seed predation** by herbivores.
>[!WARNING]- Contextual Limitation
> This list is a simplified classification—real-world desert plants may exhibit hybrid traits (e.g., spiky fruits with soft seeds).
