### SUMMARY
Investigates why drones fail to account for weather and atmospheric factors in movement, despite critical issues in wind, pressure, and air density calculations.

### DETAILS
The report identifies four critical issues in drone weather integration: (1) missing weather system access in `BaseDrone`, (2) unapplied wind forces in drone physics, (3) hardcoded air density values ignoring altitude/pressure variations, and (4) thrust calculations without density adjustments. These omissions likely cause drones to underperform in varied atmospheric conditions.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`BaseDrone.compute_control()`**: Motion pattern calculation without weather input.
- **`weather_system.apply_wind_force()`**: Exists but is never invoked in `BaseDrone.update()`.
- **`mission_config.py` (line 48)**: Hardcoded `air_density` (1.225 kg/m³) across all configurations.
- **`motion_patterns/*.py` (lines 156, 141, 352)**: Hardcoded `rho` values for thrust/drag calculations.
- **`battery_model.py` (line 75)**: Drag calculations use fixed air density.

### DEPENDENCIES
`simulation/swarm/base_drone.py`, `simulation/swarm/weather_system.py`, `simulation/swarm/motion_patterns/`, `simulation/swarm/mission_config.py`, `simulation/swarm/battery_model.py`

### USAGE
To fix these issues, integrate weather data into `BaseDrone` via:
1. Adding `weather_system` attribute in `__init__`.
2. Passing dynamic wind/pressure values to `compute_control()`.
3. Replacing hardcoded `air_density` with altitude/pressure-dependent calculations.
4. Updating thrust/drag formulas to include density factors.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Weather Integration
> Missing weather system integration means drones ignore wind, pressure, and altitude effects entirely, leading to inaccurate flight dynamics.
>[!WARNING]- Hardcoded Density Risk
> Fixed air density (1.225 kg/m³) assumes sea level—drones at high altitudes suffer reduced lift and inefficient thrust calculations.
