### SUMMARY
Implements stage-specific visual enhancements and accessibility features using color psychology to improve user experience across multiple application stages.

### DETAILS
This implementation applies research-backed color schemes to distinct application stages, enhancing visual identity, focus states, and interactive feedback. Each stage (e.g., World, Generate, Link) receives a unique accent color tied to its psychological purpose (e.g., Earth Green for stability, Creative Purple for creativity). The design includes stage-specific hover effects, focus rings, and button styling, ensuring accessibility compliance (WCAG AA contrast ratios) and keyboard navigation support. The system modifies Vue components and CSS files to enforce these visual rules, improving usability and visual coherence.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Stage-Specific Color Application**: Assigns distinct accent colors to each UI stage based on psychological research.
- **Focus State Enhancement**: Adds visible focus rings (e.g., green for World Stage) for keyboard accessibility.
- **Hover/Active State Improvements**: Enhances interactive elements with stage-specific color transitions and shadows.
- **Button Styling**: Customizes primary buttons with stage colors, hover effects, and smooth transitions.
- **WCAG Compliance**: Ensures text/background contrast meets accessibility standards (4.5:1 ratio).
- **Visual Feedback**: Improves user clarity with distinct visual cues for selections, transitions, and interactions.

### DEPENDENCIES
`vue`, `vue-components` (e.g., `WorldStage.vue`, `ChapterStage.vue`), `css`, `ui-beta` (project-specific styles).

### USAGE
1. **Development**: Replace default stage components (e.g., `WorldStage.vue`) with modified versions in `ui-beta/src/components/stages/`.
2. **Testing**: Validate focus states, color contrast, and hover effects via browser dev tools or automated tests.
3. **Deployment**: Integrate modified CSS files (e.g., `generate-stage.css`) into the frontend build pipeline.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- **Stage-Specific Color Override**
> Each stage’s accent color is dynamically applied via CSS classes (e.g., `:focus` rules) to ensure consistency across components. Override logic must account for inherited styles (e.g., `outline-offset`).
>[!WARNING]- **Color Conflicts**
> Shared components (e.g., buttons) may require conditional styling to avoid visual clashes between stages. Test edge cases where colors overlap (e.g., Story Stage and Generate Stage both use `#9c27b0`).
