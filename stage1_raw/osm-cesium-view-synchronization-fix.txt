### **TYPE**
code-fix

### **SUMMARY**
Fixes OSM-Cesium view synchronization issues, ensuring proper loading of 2D/3D OSM data and accurate camera alignment between OSM and Plotly views.

### **DETAILS**
This fix resolves synchronization and rendering problems between OSM (OpenStreetMap) and Cesium viewers. The core issue was that OSM imagery, buildings, and camera positioning were not loading correctly, causing blank screens or incorrect visuals. The solution includes explicit layer visibility checks, forced renders, delayed loading retries, and proper camera alignment to maintain consistent viewpoints across toggles between OSM and Plotly.

### **KEY_FUNCTIONS**
- **`osm-integration-box.js`**: Handles OSM imagery, building entity rendering, and view synchronization logic.
  - `explicit imagery layer visibility checks` – Forces OSM tiles to load.
  - `forced render after building creation` – Ensures 3D buildings appear in Cesium.
  - `delayed imagery loading retries` – Retries loading imagery at 100ms, 500ms, and 1000ms intervals.
- **`simulation/frontend/app-data.js`**: Manages GPS-based camera positioning for OSM view synchronization.

### **DEPENDENCIES**
Cesium.js, Plotly.js, Overpass API (for building data), WebGL-enabled browser.

### **USAGE**
1. Toggle between OSM and Plotly views.
2. OSM now loads imagery and buildings at the current GPS location.
3. Camera remains synchronized—switching back to Plotly retains the same simulation area.

### **CALLOUTS**
>[!INFO]- **Imagery Loading Retries**
> The fix includes a retry mechanism for OSM imagery (100ms, 500ms, 1000ms delays) to handle timing issues.
>[!WARNING]- **GPS-Based Synchronization**
> Ensure the simulation’s base coordinates (0,0,0) align with real-world GPS locations for accurate camera positioning.
