### SUMMARY
Generates a screenshot of a drone simulation UI by controlling drones and capturing the rendered output.

### DETAILS
This script automates the process of creating a visual representation of an HMRS (Hypothetical Multi-Robot Simulation) by:
1. Sending movement commands via an API to drones to create visible paths.
2. Waiting for the simulation to render drone paths and building detections.
3. Using Selenium in headless mode to navigate to the simulation UI, trigger a quad view, and capture a screenshot.

The script relies on a local API (`http://localhost:5007`) to interact with drones and the simulation UI.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **send_command(drone_name, target)**: Sends a movement command to a drone via HTTP POST to `/api/command`.
- **take_screenshot()**: Initializes a headless Chrome driver, navigates to the simulation URL, triggers the quad view, and saves a screenshot to `simulation_output/hmrs_simulation_screenshot.png`.
- **main()**: Orchestrates the entire workflow: checks simulation health, verifies API connectivity, and initiates the screenshot process.

### DEPENDENCIES
requests, selenium, time, json

### USAGE
1. Ensure the HMRS simulation is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5007`.
2. Run the script to:
   - Send drone movement commands (if needed).
   - Capture the simulation UI in quad view mode.
   - Save the screenshot to `simulation_output/`.
3. Modify `BASE_URL` or `screenshot_path` if the simulation runs on a different host/port.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The script assumes the simulation UI contains a **"Quad View"** button. If the button’s name/location differs, update the XPath in `take_screenshot()`.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Headless Chrome may fail if the simulation UI relies on dynamic JavaScript rendering. Increase `time.sleep()` values if plots fail to render. Avoid running this in environments with restricted network access.
