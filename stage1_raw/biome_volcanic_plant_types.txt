### TYPE
biome-classification

### SUMMARY
Defines plant types adapted to volcanic environments, emphasizing heat tolerance and rock-dwelling traits.

### DETAILS
This file categorizes plant types found in volcanic biomes, focusing on adaptations like heat resistance and substrate dependency. The terms describe functional traits rather than taxonomic classifications, targeting ecological roles in extreme environments. The categories reflect evolutionary pressures from volcanic activity, such as thermal stress and mineral-rich substrates.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Lithophyte**: Plants that grow on or consume rock surfaces, adapted to unstable volcanic terrain.
- **Thermo-flora**: Heat-tolerant flora thriving near geothermal vents, exhibiting high thermal resilience.
- **Moss-analogue**: Ground-covering organisms resembling mosses but adapted to volcanic conditions, often thriving in nutrient-poor, acidic soils.
- **Shrub-like Form**: Compact, resilient shrubs that grow in volcanic soils, providing structural stability and habitat.

### DEPENDENCIES
none

### USAGE
Used in ecological studies, game design (e.g., biome generation), or documentation of volcanic ecosystems to classify and describe plant adaptations.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Ecological Role
> These terms are **functional traits**, not taxonomic groups, meaning they describe adaptations rather than species identities. For example, "Lithophyte" refers to plants that exploit rock surfaces, not a specific genus.
>[!WARNING]- Context Sensitivity
> Terms like "Thermo-flora" assume a volcanic heat gradient—misapplication in non-geothermal environments may lead to incorrect ecological assumptions. Always verify environmental conditions when using these classifications.
