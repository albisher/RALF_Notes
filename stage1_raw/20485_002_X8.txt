### SUMMARY
Log documenting initial water source mapping in the River Delta Region, noting discrepancies between projections and observations.

### DETAILS
This log records the first mapping of a primary water source in the River Delta Region (31.2° N, 34.2° E) on Sol 002 (year 20485). The mission observed consistent water flow but found the route deeper than initially predicted. Water purity analysis remains pending, and the log notes uncertainty in sensor reliability. Minor adjustments were required for sensor calibration, with low energy consumption during the operation. The entry emphasizes refining water collection strategies and assessing long-term sustainability of the resource, with a request for additional support to confirm findings.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Water Source Mapping**: Identifying and analyzing the primary water route in the region.
- **Sensor Calibration Adjustments**: Fixing minor issues in sensor performance.
- **Resource Sustainability Assessment**: Evaluating long-term viability of water collection.

### DEPENDENCIES
none (internal mission documentation)

### USAGE
This log serves as a record for mission planning, sensor validation, and resource management teams. It highlights areas needing further investigation (e.g., water purity, sensor reliability) and suggests refining collection strategies.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The discrepancy between predicted and observed water route depth suggests potential geological or hydrological anomalies that require further study.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Sensor reliability is uncertain; pending calibration adjustments may impact data accuracy. Cross-check results with additional tests.
