### SUMMARY
A demo script for interacting with a backend API to create and populate a cyberpunk-themed world database with worlds, characters, and elements.

### DETAILS
This script uses Axios to interact with a local API (`https://localhost:8443/api`) for authentication, world management, and generating narrative elements. It handles login, retrieves existing worlds, creates a new cyberpunk world, generates a protagonist character with cybernetic appearance, and dynamically generates world elements (locations, buildings, plants) with predefined descriptions. Error handling includes fallback logic for duplicate world checks and logging for debugging.

The script dynamically constructs story content for a cyberpunk protagonist (Cyber-Samurai Kaito) tied to the generated world, though it cuts off mid-story. It also bypasses SSL certificate validation for testing self-signed certificates.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **login**: Authenticates with the API using hardcoded credentials (`test`/`passtest`).
- **getWorlds**: Fetches all worlds from the API with an auth token.
- **createWorld**: Creates a new world (or retrieves an existing demo world if one exists).
- **generateCharacterWithAppearance**: Creates a cyberpunk-themed character with a specified role and appearance type.
- **generateElement**: Dynamically generates world elements (locations, buildings, plants) with customizable names and descriptions.
- **createStoryElement**: (Incomplete) Attempts to generate a narrative story tied to the world (abruptly cut off).

### DEPENDENCIES
axios, fs, path, https

### USAGE
1. Run the script after ensuring the backend API (`localhost:8443`) is running.
2. Execute functions sequentially:
   - `login()` to authenticate.
   - `getWorlds()` to list existing worlds.
   - `createWorld()` to create a new cyberpunk world.
   - `generateCharacterWithAppearance(worldId)` to create a protagonist.
   - `generateElement(worldId, elementType)` to generate locations/buildings/plants.
   - `createStoryElement(worldId)` to populate narrative content (abandoned mid-execution).

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Hardcoded Credentials
> **Security Risk**: The script uses hardcoded credentials (`test`/`passtest`) for login. In production, replace with environment variables or secure authentication.
>[!WARNING]- SSL Bypass
> **Testing Limitation**: SSL certificate verification is disabled (`rejectUnauthorized: false`) for self-signed certificates. Use only in trusted development environments; disable in production.
>[!WARNING]- Incomplete Story Generation
> **Partial Execution**: The `createStoryElement` function cuts off abruptly after generating partial story content. The script may need extension to complete narrative logic.
