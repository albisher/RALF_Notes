### SUMMARY
Agent designed to perform rigorous verification of task implementations marked for review, ensuring compliance with specifications, code quality, and test coverage before approval.

### DETAILS
The `task-checker` agent is a specialized quality assurance tool that systematically evaluates tasks marked as 'review' by:
1. Retrieving task specifications and test requirements via the `mcp__task-master-ai__get_task` tool
2. Examining implementation files using `Read` and pattern matching with `Grep`
3. Executing build and test commands via `Bash` to validate functionality
4. Assessing code quality against project conventions (TypeScript typing, error handling, documentation)
5. Validating all dependencies and integration points

It operates as a gatekeeper between implementation and completion, generating structured verification reports that classify tasks as PASS, PARTIAL, or FAIL based on predefined decision criteria.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **Task Specification Review**: Extracts and analyzes requirements from task metadata
- **Implementation Verification**: Validates file existence, content, and structure against specifications
- **Test Execution**: Runs automated tests and verifies build success
- **Code Quality Assessment**: Evaluates adherence to project standards (typing, error handling, documentation)
- **Dependency Validation**: Checks integration with related tasks and system stability
- **Report Generation**: Produces YAML-formatted verification reports with detailed findings

### DEPENDENCIES
`mcp__task-master-ai__get_task`, `Read` tool, `Bash` tool, `Grep` tool

### USAGE
1. Trigger when a task is marked 'review' by the task-executor
2. Agent retrieves task details and executes verification workflow
3. Generates structured report with:
   - Task status (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)
   - Met requirements checklist
   - Found issues/warnings
   - Test results
   - Recommendations
4. Output determines whether task proceeds to 'done' or returns to 'pending'

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Critical Role
>This agent acts as the sole quality gate between implementation and completion, preventing incomplete or low-quality work from being marked as done.
>[!WARNING]- Strict Non-Interference
>Never modify code or implement fixes - only verify existing implementations against requirements. All corrections must be handled by the task-executor.
