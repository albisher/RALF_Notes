### SUMMARY
Manages a Scan-Plan-Execute-Verify state machine for mission operations, tracking transitions and durations.

### DETAILS
This code implements a state machine for a mission system following the Scan-Plan-Execute-Verify workflow. It uses an `Enum` to define mission phases (`SCAN`, `PLAN`, `EXECUTE`, `VERIFY`) and enforces valid transitions between them. The `MissionStateMachineBox` class tracks phase durations, records transitions in a history log, and validates transitions based on predefined rules (e.g., `SCAN` must precede `PLAN`). Time tracking is used to measure phase execution durations.

### KEY_FUNCTIONS
- **`MissionPhase`**: Defines mission phases as an `Enum` for structured state representation.
- **`MissionStateMachineBox.__init__()`**: Initializes the state machine with default `SCAN` phase and starts tracking time.
- **`transition_to_phase()`**: Handles state transitions, validates them, logs history, and returns transition metadata.
- **`_validate_transition()`**: Private method enforcing valid transitions (e.g., `PLAN` only after `SCAN`).

### DEPENDENCIES
`enum`, `typing`, `time`

### USAGE
1. Instantiate `MissionStateMachineBox()` to start.
2. Call `transition_to_phase(new_phase)` with a valid `MissionPhase` and optional reason.
3. Check `current_phase` and `phase_history` for state tracking.

### CALLOUTS
>[!INFO]- Important Note
> The `_validate_transition()` method enforces strict rules (e.g., `VERIFY` can only transition to `SCAN` or `EXECUTE`). Violations return `valid=False`.
>[!WARNING]- Caution
> Time-based transitions (e.g., `SCAN` → `PLAN`) assume phase completion is time-based; ensure logic aligns with actual mission criteria.
