  "summary": "Defines rigorous research methodology for AI validation using peer-reviewed sources and reproducibility standards.",
  "details": "The document establishes a structured approach to validating AI research by emphasizing peer-reviewed publications (e.g., ICRA, NeurIPS), reproducibility through open-source code/data, and prioritizing recent (2020–2025) findings. It highlights the effectiveness of ‘many small AI dreams’ (short simulations) over long ones, requiring cross-verification across multiple sources. Tools like Perplexity MCP and video summaries (TwoMinutePapers) aid in sourcing and validating research.",
