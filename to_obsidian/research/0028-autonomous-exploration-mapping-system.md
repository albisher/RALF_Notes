It generates point clouds by casting rays from a drone's position at 10Hz, applying ±2cm noise, and handling occlusions. Vertical and horizontal scanning angles are defined to replicate LiDAR specifications, with ray transformations accounting for drone orientation.","key_functions":[{"name":"scan_environment","purpose":"Performs ray-based LiDAR scanning with noise and occlusion handling to generate point clouds"},{"name":"_transform_to_world","purpose":"Converts LiDAR ray directions from sensor frame to world frame using drone orientation"}],"dependencies":["PyBullet physics engine","NumPy for array operations"],"usage":"Extend `AdvancedLiDARBox` by inheriting `EnhancedLiDARBox` and integrating into drone simulation workflows for autonomous mapping.
