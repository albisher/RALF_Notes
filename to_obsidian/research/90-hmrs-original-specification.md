{"filename":"hmrs_original_specification","tags":["#aerial-robotics","#drone-systems","#vertical-cleaning","#3d-mapping","#logistics","#quality-assurance"],"type":"code-notes","summary":"Legacy HMRS specification for a three-drone system (Scout, Tanker, Overseer) optimizing vertical-surface window cleaning via aerial mapping, logistics, and quality control.","details":"This document outlines a deprecated three-drone architecture—**Scout** (LiDAR/photogrammetry mapping), **Tanker** (mid-air resupply or tethered power), and **Overseer** (quality inspection)—designed to address limitations in robotic window cleaning. The Scout uses DJI Matrice 350 RTK with Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR for centimeter-accurate mapping, while the Tanker offers two resupply methods (cartridge swap or tethered power). The Overseer ensures cleaning quality via visual inspection. The system emphasizes energy efficiency, redundancy, and compliance with NDAA/Blue UAS regulations.","key_functions":[{"name":"Scout","purpose":"Generates real-time 3D surface maps and hazard detection using LiDAR/photogrammetry for obstacle avoidance and cleaning fluid optimization"},{"name":"Tanker","purpose":"Provides mid-air resupply (Option A) or continuous power via tether (Option B) to eliminate payload descent cycles"},{"name":"Overseer","purpose":"Performs quality inspection and bird deterrence while trailing the climber"}],"dependencies":["DJI Matrice 350 RTK","Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR","Intel RealSense D455","Freefly Astro","AprilTag fiducials","PID control systems","RTK/GNSS positioning"],"usage":"To integrate the HMRS system, deploy Scout for mapping, configure Tanker for resupply/tethering, and deploy Overseer for inspection. Verify proprietary components (e.g., docking systems) against open-source alternatives.","related":["[[HMRS/00-executive-overview.md]]","[[HMRS/01-scout-specification.md]]","[[HMRS/02-tanker-specification.md]]","[[HMRS/03-overseer-specification.md]]"],"callouts":[
