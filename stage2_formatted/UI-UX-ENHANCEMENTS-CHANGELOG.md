# UI-UX-ENHANCEMENTS-CHANGELOG

## Summary

```
A UI/UX enhancement changelog detailing visual and interactive improvements for a web application, including color schemes, animations, and responsive design updates.
```

## Details

> This changelog documents UI/UX enhancements for a web application, introducing a modern Material Design-inspired color palette, refined visual hierarchy, and improved interactive elements. Key changes include updated gradients, shadows, borders, and contrast for accessibility compliance. Interactive components like buttons, forms, cards, and modals received gradient backgrounds, ripple animations, and hover effects.

The design maintains responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
