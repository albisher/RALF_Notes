# height_categories

## Summary

```
Defines standardized height categories for classification systems.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates predefined height categories used for categorizing individuals or objects based on relative height measurements. The categories are designed to provide a structured way to classify heights into broad, descriptive groups, ranging from "Very Short" to "Towering," and from "Petite" to "Large." These labels are likely used in applications requiring standardized height classification, such as demographic studies, fitness assessments, or design guidelines.

## Key Functions

### `None`

This is a static data file listing predefined height categories rather than a functional program.

## Usage

This file serves as a reference for implementing height classification logic in other systems. Example usage:
```plaintext
If height is categorized as "Tall," assign a corresponding value or behavior.
```
The categories can be referenced directly in code, APIs, or documentation to ensure consistent classification.

>[!INFO] Standardization Note
> These categories are meant for broad classification and may not account for individual variations. For precise measurements, use calibrated instruments or specialized software.

>[!WARNING] Context-Dependent Use
> The exact interpretation of terms like "Average" or "Tall" may vary by application (e.g., child vs. adult standards). Always validate against domain-specific criteria.
