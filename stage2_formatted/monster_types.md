>[!INFO] Common Use Cases
> Many of these creatures appear in D&D’s *Monster Manual* and supplementary materials, where they are fleshed out with stats, behaviors, and lore.

>[!WARNING] Avoid Overuse
> While versatile, some creatures (e.g., generic "horror" or "void spawn") lack depth—ensure specificity when designing encounters to maintain narrative cohesion.
