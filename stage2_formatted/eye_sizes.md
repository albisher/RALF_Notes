# eye_sizes

## Summary

```
Classifies eye sizes into predefined categories for stylistic or design reference.
```

## Details

> This file defines a simple categorical system for eye sizes, likely used in design, fashion, or aesthetic applications. The categories (`Miniature`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `Oversized`) represent relative size ranges, potentially for visual or functional comparisons (e.g., in character design, UI mockups, or artistic references).

## Key Functions

### `Categorization`

Assigns eye sizes to standardized labels for consistency.

### `Reference`

Acts as a lookup table for visual or design purposes.

## Usage

This file is likely intended for:
- Designers or artists to categorize eye sizes in a project.
- Programmers to integrate into a system requiring size classification (e.g., a UI framework or character generator).
- Researchers studying visual proportions or trends.

>[!INFO] Contextual Use
> These labels may correspond to specific thresholds (e.g., "Small" could imply a width/height ratio below 1.2x, while "Oversized" exceeds 1.8x). Clarify thresholds if used programmatically.

>[!WARNING] Ambiguity
> Terms like "Medium" or "Large" are subjective; ensure alignment with project-specific definitions to avoid inconsistencies.
