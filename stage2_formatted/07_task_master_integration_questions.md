# 07_task_master_integration_questions

## Summary

```
Explores integration and configuration decisions for a task automation system (Task-Master CLI) within a project workflow.
```

## Details

> This document outlines a structured set of questions addressing how Task-Master CLI should be integrated into a project, covering initialization, task generation, research, model configuration, workflow management, and future planning. The questions span technical (e.g., PRD format, complexity thresholds) and organizational (e.g., task dependencies, collaboration) aspects, aiming to define a cohesive system for task management and project documentation.

## Key Functions

### `Project Initialization`

Determine setup location, project name, and structure.

### `PRD Creation & Parsing`

Define file format, task generation count, and research integration.

### `Task Organization`

Define content categorization, tags, and dependency structures.

### `Complexity & Subtasks`

Set thresholds, research usage, and subtask generation rules.

### `Research Integration`

Define queries, detail levels, and result storage.

### `Model Configuration`

Select primary AI models and fallback options.

### `Workflow Management`

Plan ongoing task updates, status tracking, and syncs.

### `Development Integration`

Link Task-Master with sprint planning, bug tracking, and version control.

### `Reporting & Analytics`

Define complexity reports, progress visualization, and data export.

### `Customization`

Tailor rules, templates, and collaboration features.

### `Maintenance & Documentation`

Establish update schedules, backups, and team training.

## Usage

This document serves as a decision-making guide for integrating Task-Master CLI into a project, requiring input from stakeholders to align technical and organizational requirements.

>[!INFO] Important Note
> Questions 1–44 focus on foundational setup and technical configuration, while questions 45–52 address documentation, QA, and team adoption. Prioritize consistency across these areas to avoid fragmentation.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Overly rigid task templates (e.g., Q39) may limit adaptability. Balance standardization with flexibility for project-specific needs.
