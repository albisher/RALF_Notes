## Summary

```
A catalog of planetary arrangement patterns, orbital characteristics, and dynamical configurations observed in planetary systems, including both solar and extrasolar systems.
```

## Details

> This file outlines distinct configurations of planetary systems, describing how planets are distributed in terms of their orbital types, compositions, and stability. It categorizes systems based on orbital mechanics such as eccentricity, inclination, and resonance, which influence planetary migration, stability, and formation. The terms reflect observed patterns in the Solar System and exoplanet populations, highlighting differences between rocky planets, gas giants, and icy bodies, as well as extreme cases like migrating or captured objects.

## Key Functions

### `Inner Rocky Planets`

Describes tightly packed, Earth-like planets orbiting close to their star.

### `Outer Gas Giants`

Refers to massive, gaseous planets (e.g., Jupiter-like) in distant orbits.

### `Mixed Configuration`

Systems with both rocky and gas giant planets in close proximity.

### `Hot Jupiters`

Gas giants with highly eccentric or close-in orbits, often misaligned.

### `Super-Earth Cluster`

Group of Earth-sized planets with similar orbital properties.

### `Mini-Neptune Group`

Smaller, Neptune-like planets with varying orbital dynamics.

### `Asteroid Belt Division`

A region of debris or small bodies between inner and outer planets.

### `Kuiper Belt Objects`

Icy bodies in the outer solar system, often in resonant orbits.

### `Scattered Disk Region`

Chaotic, distant objects with highly eccentric orbits.

### `Trojan Asteroids`

Objects sharing orbital resonances with planets (e.g., Jupiter’s Trojans).

### `Co-orbital Bodies`

Planets or moons that share the same orbital path.

### `Resonant Chains`

Systems where planets maintain stable orbital relationships via mean motion resonances.

### `Compact Systems`

Planets closely packed with minimal orbital separation.

### `Wide Separation`

Planets spaced far apart, reducing dynamical interactions.

### `Eccentric Orbits`

Highly elliptical orbits, often linked to migration or instability.

### `Retrograde Motion`

Planets orbiting in the opposite direction to their star’s rotation.

### `Inclined Orbits`

Planets with orbits tilted relative to the stellar equator.

### `Chaotic Dynamics`

Unpredictable orbital behavior due to gravitational perturbations.

### `Stable Resonance`

Long-term orbital stability maintained by resonance effects.

### `Migrating Planets`

Planets that have shifted their orbits significantly over time.

### `Captured Objects`

Bodies gravitationally bound to planets or stars after an encounter.

## Usage

This file serves as a reference for astronomers, planetary scientists, and researchers studying orbital mechanics, exoplanet formation, and dynamical evolution. It can be used to classify observed systems, discuss theoretical models, or compare solar system dynamics with extrasolar planets.

>[!INFO] Key Distinction
> Inner rocky planets typically form in the "snowline" boundary, where volatile compounds freeze, while outer gas giants form beyond this region. This division is critical for understanding planetary composition and migration.

>[!WARNING] Instability Risk
> Systems with wide separation or chaotic dynamics may be dynamically unstable, leading to planet-planet scattering or catastrophic collisions. Observations of such systems often require careful modeling to predict long-term stability.
