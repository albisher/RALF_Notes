## Summary

```
Classifies stellar life stages into distinct evolutionary phases.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates and defines the sequential stages of stellar evolution, from initial formation to final remnants. Each term represents a distinct phase in a star’s lifecycle, capturing transitions from proto-stellar formation through prime maturity to eventual death. The stages are ordered chronologically, reflecting physical processes like nuclear fusion, mass loss, and stellar death.

## Key Functions

### `Proto-formation`

Early dense molecular cloud collapse leading to star birth.

### `Newborn`

Initial phase post-nuclear ignition, characterized by rapid expansion.

### `Young/Adolescent`

Hydrogen fusion stabilizes; star enters main sequence.

### `Mature/Prime`

Core hydrogen exhausted; helium fusion begins (red giant/branch).

### `Stable/Middle-aged`

Longest phase (main sequence), balancing fusion and gravity.

### `Declining/Late Stage`

Core contracts; outer layers expand (red giant/supergiant).

### `End Phase/Dying`

Core collapses (white dwarf/supernova remnant).

### `Post-stellar/Remnant`

Remaining stellar core or ejected material (e.g., planetary nebula).

## Usage

This list is used in astrophysics to describe stellar aging, categorize observations, or model stellar evolution in simulations. Example: *"A G2V star is classified as ‘Middle-aged’ in this system."*

>[!INFO] **Order Matters**
> Stages follow a deterministic sequence based on stellar mass and initial conditions. For example, high-mass stars skip "Middle-aged" entirely, dying as supernovae.

>[!WARNING] **Ambiguity in Terms**
> Some terms (e.g., "Young" vs. "Adolescent") lack strict definitions—context (e.g., mass class) clarifies distinctions. Avoid overgeneralizing.
