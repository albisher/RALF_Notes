## Summary

```
A list of key **astronomical measurement and observational techniques** used in studying stellar, galactic, and extragalactic phenomena across the electromagnetic spectrum.
```

## Details

> This file appears to enumerate **fundamental observational markers and methods** employed in modern astronomy to determine distances, velocities, and properties of celestial objects. These techniques span stellar dynamics, supernovae classification, gravitational wave sources, and high-energy astrophysics. The entries cover both classical (e.g., Cepheid variables, Type Ia supernovae) and cutting-edge methods (e.g., gravitational wave sources, fast radio bursts), reflecting interdisciplinary applications in cosmology, astrophysics, and space-based astronomy.

## Key Functions

### `Pulsar Timing`

Precise timing of millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves and probe the Milky Way’s structure.

### `Type Ia Supernovae`

Standardizable "candles" for cosmological distance measurements via light curves and spectra.

### `Gravitational Wave Sources`

Direct detection of mergers (e.g., black hole binaries, neutron star collisions) via LIGO/Virgo.

### `Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)`

Unidentified high-energy transient signals used to probe intergalactic medium and dark matter.

### `Kilonova Events`

Electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, tracing heavy-element nucleosynthesis.

## Usage

This list serves as a **reference for astronomers** when selecting methods for:
- **Distance scaling** (e.g., Cepheids, supernovae).
- **Galactic/extragalactic kinematics** (e.g., binary pulsars, microlensing).
- **High-energy astrophysics** (e.g., gamma-ray bursts, neutrinos).
- **Cosmological probes** (e.g., quasar reference frames, cosmic ray directions).

## Dependencies

> `None (standalone list of observational techniques; may reference broader frameworks like *astrometry*`
> `*spectroscopy*`
> `or *gravitational wave analysis* in related analyses).`

>[!INFO] **Cosmological Context**
> Many of these markers (e.g., Type Ia SNe, Cepheids) are foundational for the **Hubble constant** and dark energy studies, bridging local astrophysics with large-scale cosmology.

>[!WARNING] **Methodological Overlap**
> Techniques like **surface brightness fluctuations** and **Tully-Fisher** compete for distance measurements but serve complementary roles (e.g., intra vs. intergalactic scales). Overlap requires careful cross-validation.
