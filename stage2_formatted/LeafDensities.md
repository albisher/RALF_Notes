# LeafDensities

## Summary

```
Describes categorical density classifications for leaf distribution analysis.
```

## Details

> This appears to define a set of **leaf density categories** (`sparse`, `normal`, `dense`, `very dense`) used to classify leaf distribution patterns in ecological or environmental studies. These labels likely correspond to visual or quantitative assessments of leaf coverage density in plant canopies or study plots.

## Key Functions

### `Density Classification`

Assigns leaf density levels for analysis (e.g., habitat assessment, biodiversity studies).

### `Comparative Analysis`

Enables comparison between different environmental conditions or species.

## Usage

- Used in field surveys, remote sensing, or lab studies to categorize leaf density visually or via measurements (e.g., leaf area index).
- Often paired with spatial data (e.g., GIS maps) or statistical models for further analysis.

>[!INFO] Contextual Use
> These terms are typically applied in **leaf canopy studies** where density impacts light penetration, species interactions, or ecosystem function.

>[!WARNING] Subjectivity Warning
> Visual classification may vary between observers; consider quantitative thresholds (e.g., % leaf cover) for consistency.
