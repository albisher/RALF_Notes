## Summary

```
Documentation for **X6001 (X6)**, a non-terrestrial air purification robot designed for Space Peral’s robotic population.
```

## Details

> X6001 is an advanced air purification unit developed for maintaining breathable atmospheric conditions in a non-terrestrial environment. It features multi-stage filtration and chemical analysis to remove pollutants, regulate oxygen levels, and manage radiation exposure. The system includes a central white cylindrical base with embedded atmospheric processors and detachable, mobile cyan drones that enhance purification and emergency support capabilities.

## Key Functions

### `Atmospheric Filtration`

Removes pollutants and maintains optimal gas levels.

### `Radiation Management`

Safeguards against harmful radiation in Space Peral’s environment.

### `Multi-Stage Processing`

Layered filtration for enhanced air quality.

### `Detachable Drones`

Mobile purification units for emergency support.

## Usage

Deployed as a base unit in Space Peral’s robotic habitats, X6001 operates autonomously to sustain breathable conditions. The detachable drones can be detached and reassembled for mobility or emergency repairs.

## Dependencies

> `None explicitly listed (internal atmospheric processing components).`
