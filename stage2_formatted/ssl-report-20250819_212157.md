## Summary

```
Generates an SSL report for a localhost development environment, detailing certificate status, security headers, and recommendations for secure HTTPS deployment.
```

## Details

> This file documents the SSL certificate status for the **Space Pearl Project**, specifically for a self-signed certificate used in a local development setup. It includes details about the certificate validity, expiry, and HTTPS configuration (ports, protocols). Security headers like HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and others are confirmed as configured. The report also provides actionable recommendations for production use, such as replacing self-signed certificates with Let’s Encrypt and securing firewall rules.
> 
> The report references generated scripts (`setup-ssl-simple.sh`, `validate-ssl.sh`) used to validate and configure SSL in the project.

## Key Functions

### `SSL Certificate Validation`

Confirms certificate validity, expiry, and type (self-signed).

### `HTTPS Configuration Check`

Validates ports (8080 → HTTPS redirect on 8443) and TLS protocol support (TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3).

### `Security Header Enforcement`

Ensures compliance with HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and X-Content-Type-Options.

### `Recommendation Generation`

Provides best practices for production SSL deployment.

## Usage

1. Review certificate details (validity, expiry) for compliance.
2. Use provided scripts (`setup-ssl-simple.sh`, `validate-ssl.sh`) to automate SSL setup/validation.
3. Apply recommendations (e.g., replace self-signed certs, secure firewall rules) for production environments.

## Dependencies

> `None (standalone report; relies on external scripts for setup/validation).`

>[!INFO] Important Note
> Self-signed certificates are insecure for production; replace with Let’s Encrypt certificates immediately.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Hardcoding HTTPS port (8443) in production may conflict with firewall rules; validate firewall policies.
