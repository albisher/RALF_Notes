# e70966888586_add_timeline_and_timelineevent_models

## Summary

```
Creates and updates SQL schema for `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent` models in a database.
```

## Details

> This file is an Alembic migration script that generates SQL commands to add the `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent` tables to a database. The script is structured to handle both the `upgrade` (forward migration) and `downgrade` (reverse migration) operations. Currently, the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions are empty stubs, likely awaiting custom SQL logic to define table structures, constraints, and relationships.
> 
> The migration revision ID (`e70966888586`) depends on a previous revision (`7748df999976`), indicating this is part of a sequence of schema changes.

## Key Functions

### `upgrade()`

Executes SQL commands to create the `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent` tables in the database.

### `downgrade()`

Executes SQL commands to roll back the changes made by the `upgrade()` function.

## Usage

To apply this migration:
1. Run `alembic upgrade head` in the project directory to apply the migration.
2. The script should define table creation logic in the `upgrade()` function (currently empty).
3. For rollback, use `alembic downgrade` to revert changes.

## Dependencies

> `- Alembic (`alembic`)
- SQLAlchemy (`sqlalchemy`)`

>[!INFO] Important Note
> This script is a template generated by Alembic. Custom SQL logic must be added to `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` to define table structures, columns, constraints, and relationships for `Timeline` and `TimelineEvent`.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Ensure proper dependencies are set (e.g., `depends_on`) if the migration relies on other migrations or database states. Currently, `depends_on` is set to `None`.
