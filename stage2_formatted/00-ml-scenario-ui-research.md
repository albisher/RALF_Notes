## Summary

```
Research document outlining best practices for integrating ML scenario building and learning features into an existing HMRS Live Simulation UI (port 5007).
```

## Details

> This document details a research plan for enhancing the UI of a live simulation system by incorporating machine learning (ML) scenario building and learning capabilities. The focus is on designing a user-friendly interface that merges real-time simulation, scenario management, and ML learning visualization. Key findings include user-centered design principles, UI component organization, and modern UI/UX patterns to improve efficiency and engagement.

## Key Functions

### `Scenario Management Panel`

Organizes and filters available scenarios with quick creation and template access.

### `Learning Visualization`

Displays real-time ML metrics like loss, accuracy, and success rates.

### `Interactive Scenario Builder`

Allows drag-and-drop scenario sequencing and parameter configuration.

### `Live Learning Monitor`

Provides real-time drone behavior and learning session tracking.

### `Tab-Based Navigation`

Structures UI into main simulation, ML scenarios, learning monitor, and analytics tabs.

### `AI-Powered Features`

Suggests scenarios, tunes parameters, and detects anomalies based on user history.

## Usage

This document serves as a research roadmap for developers and designers working on integrating ML features into the existing UI framework. It provides guidelines for designing intuitive, efficient, and modern UI components to enhance user experience.

## Dependencies

>[!INFO] **User-Centered Focus**
> Prioritize ML practitioners' workflows to reduce cognitive load and improve usability by simplifying complex features with progressive disclosure.


>[!WARNING] **Integration Complexity**
> Ensure seamless integration with existing simulation systems (e.g., port 5007) while maintaining backward compatibility for users. Overlay and sidebar designs should avoid disrupting core functionality.
