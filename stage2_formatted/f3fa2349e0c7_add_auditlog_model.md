# f3fa2349e0c7_add_auditlog_model

## Summary

```
Creates an Alembic migration script to add an AuditLog model table for tracking system activities.
```

## Details

> This file is a migration script generated by Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. It defines the `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions for adding and removing an `AuditLog` table. The script is part of a database schema evolution process, where the `upgrade` function typically creates new database tables or columns, while the `downgrade` function reverses these changes. Currently, the script is empty (placeholder commands), indicating that the actual SQL creation logic for the `AuditLog` model will be implemented within the `upgrade()` function.
> 
> The `AuditLog` model will likely include fields such as `id`, `timestamp`, `user_id`, `action_type`, `table_name`, `record_id`, and `changes` to log user actions, timestamps, and modifications to database records.

## Key Functions

### `upgrade()`

Executes SQL commands to create the `AuditLog` table with audit fields.

### `downgrade()`

Executes SQL commands to remove the `AuditLog` table and revert changes.

## Usage

To apply this migration:
1. Place this script in the Alembic migration directory (e.g., `migrations/versions/`).
2. Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply the migration, which will execute the `upgrade()` function.
3. To revert, run `alembic downgrade` to execute the `downgrade()` function.

## Dependencies

> `SQLAlchemy`
> `Alembic`

>[!INFO] Important Note
> This script is a template. The actual SQL creation logic for the `AuditLog` table must be implemented inside the `upgrade()` function. The fields and structure of the `AuditLog` model should be defined based on requirements (e.g., tracking user actions, timestamps, and record changes).

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Ensure the `AuditLog` table is designed to handle high write volumes, as audit logs can grow significantly over time. Consider adding indexing or archiving strategies to manage performance and storage.
