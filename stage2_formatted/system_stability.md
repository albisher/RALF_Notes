## Summary

```
Classifies celestial or system stability into distinct categories for orbital/physical analysis.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates terms describing the stability and dynamic behavior of celestial systems, orbits, or bodies. The terms reflect varying degrees of stability, from **long-term stability** (e.g., *Long-term Stable*) to **chaotic or disruptive events** (e.g., *Tidal Disruption*, *Three-body Chaos*). These labels are likely used in simulations, modeling, or theoretical studies of orbital mechanics, gravitational interactions, or planetary systems. The list categorizes phenomena by their likelihood of persistence or instability, often tied to factors like mass ratios, orbital eccentricity, or external perturbations.

## Key Functions

### `Stability Classification`

Assigns a descriptive term to a system’s dynamic state (e.g., *Metastable*, *Quasi-periodic*).

### `Orbital Risk Assessment`

Identifies high-risk scenarios (e.g., *Collisional Activity*, *Ejection Events*) for predictive modeling.

### `Chaos Detection`

Flags systems prone to chaotic evolution (e.g., *Three-body Chaos*, *Binary Interactions*).

## Usage

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Assign terms to observed or simulated systems to categorize stability risks.
2. **Simulation Validation**: Compare predicted stability (e.g., *Tidal Disruption*) against empirical data.
3. **Research Classification**: Organize studies on orbital chaos, resonance, or dynamical evolution.

## Dependencies

> `None (standalone terminology list; may integrate with orbital mechanics libraries like `astropy` or `numpy` for simulations).`

>[!INFO] Contextual Use
> Terms like *Resonance Disruption* or *Tidal Disruption* are critical for studying exoplanets or binary star systems where gravitational interactions can destabilize orbits over time.

>[!WARNING] Overlap Warning
> Some terms (e.g., *Metastable* vs. *Quasi-periodic*) may overlap; context (e.g., timescale, body types) is essential for precise classification.
