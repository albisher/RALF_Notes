# BuildingFeatures

## Summary

```
Document outlining innovative sustainable and smart building features for eco-friendly architecture.
```

## Details

> This file lists a collection of advanced, environmentally conscious, and futuristic architectural and engineering features designed to enhance sustainability, efficiency, and smart functionality in buildings. The features span renewable energy sources, passive design elements, and innovative materials, targeting reduced environmental impact while improving occupant comfort and operational efficiency.

## Key Functions

### `Solar Panels`

Convert sunlight into electricity, reducing reliance on grid power.

### `Wind Turbines`

Generate renewable energy from wind kinetic energy.

### `Green Walls`

Improve air quality, reduce urban heat island effect, and enhance biodiversity.

### `Rooftop Garden`

Provides green space, insulation benefits, and supports local ecosystems.

### `Underground Parking`

Reduces surface area use, improves urban mobility, and lowers heat absorption.

### `Glass Elevators`

Enable energy-efficient vertical transportation with smart glass properties.

### `Rotating Floors`

Optimize space utilization in high-density environments (e.g., skyscrapers).

### `Smart Lighting`

Dynamically adjusts illumination based on occupancy, time, and ambient light.

### `Energy-Efficient Insulation`

Minimizes heat transfer, reducing energy consumption for heating/cooling.

### `Water Recycling System`

Reuses graywater or rainwater for non-potable uses, conserving freshwater.

### `Bioluminescent Lighting`

Uses living organisms to illuminate spaces sustainably (e.g., algae-based lighting).

### `Self-Healing Materials`

Repair minor damages autonomously (e.g., concrete with bacteria or graphene composites).
