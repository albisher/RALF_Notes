## Summary

```
Documentation outlining X11’s role as a public service unit for truthful, compliant news dissemination via advanced optical and semantic communication.
```

## Details

> X11 functions as a clandestine public service entity capable of broadcasting news and maintaining truthful awareness across planetary networks. Its design avoids visibility on Earth, relying on non-standard airbot components and ultra-sensitive optical tech. The system prioritizes minimal data transmission for safety while leveraging semantic communication for clarity. Power efficiency is critical for its signal-grabbing arrays.

## Key Functions

### `Optical Communication`

Uses ultralow-noise amplifiers and receivers for high-speed, reliable cross-space data transfer.

### `Semantic News Delivery`

Transmits structured, contextually relevant information to ensure comprehension.

### `Underground Design`

Conceals components to avoid detection, relying on proprietary tech.

## Usage

X11 operates as a broadcast hub, interfacing with compliant planetary networks to distribute curated news while adhering to user preferences for truthful content.

## Dependencies

> `None explicitly listed (assumes proprietary hardware/software for airbot integration).`
