# PlantTypes

## Summary

```
A simple categorization of plant types for ecological and botanical reference.
```

## Details

> This file lists basic plant types, representing fundamental ecological and morphological classifications. The categories include woody (tree, shrub, vine), non-woody (grass, moss), agricultural (crop), succulent (cactus), and flowering plants. This list serves as a foundational taxonomy for plant studies, environmental science, or agricultural applications.

## Key Functions

### ``tree``

Represents woody perennial plants with a single main stem.

### ``shrub``

Smaller woody plants with multiple stems, typically shorter than trees.

### ``vine``

Climbing or trailing plants that rely on support structures.

### ``grass``

Monocotyledonous herbaceous plants with narrow leaves.

### ``cactus``

Succulent plants adapted to arid environments.

### ``flowering plant``

Angiosperms producing flowers for reproduction.

### ``crop``

Cultivated plants grown for food, fiber, or other uses.

### ``moss``

Non-vascular bryophyte plants typically found in moist environments.

### ``flowering plant` (duplicate)`

Clarified as a broader category (see above).

## Usage

This list can be used for:
- Categorizing plant species in ecological studies.
- Designating plant types in agricultural or horticultural contexts.
- Referencing plant classifications in botanical databases or field guides.

>[!INFO] Taxonomic Context
> These categories align with basic plant morphology and ecological roles but may lack granularity for specialized research (e.g., gymnosperms, ferns). For detailed taxonomy, refer to botanical databases like IPNI or Flora of China.

>[!WARNING] Overlap Warning
> Some terms (e.g., "flowering plant") may overlap with broader classifications (e.g., angiosperms). Ensure context-specific precision when applying these labels.
