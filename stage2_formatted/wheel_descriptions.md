## Summary

```
Describes wheel characteristics for different mobility and terrain applications.
```

## Details

> This file outlines various wheel design attributes tailored for compact, high-speed, storage-friendly, and specialized mobility needs. It categorizes wheels by size, function (e.g., foldable, spiked), and intended use cases like off-road or icy terrain.

## Key Functions

### `Compact Mobility`

Tiny tires for lightweight, space-efficient movement.

### `High-Speed Travel`

Large, thin wheels optimized for speed.

### `Storage-Friendly`

Foldable wheel design for portability.

### `Omnidirectional Movement`

Ball-and-housing mechanism for pivoting motion.

### `Stability & Versatility`

Car-like wheels for balanced performance.

### `Off-Road Adaptation`

Rugged wheels for rugged terrain.

### `Uneven Surface Stability`

Small wheels for improved grip on uneven ground.

### `Icy Terrain Traction`

Spiked wheels for slip resistance.

## Usage

This document serves as a reference for selecting or designing wheels based on specific mobility requirements (e.g., storage needs, terrain, speed). Engineers, designers, or users can reference these descriptions to match wheel types to applications.

>[!INFO] Key Trade-offs
> Wheel size and shape directly impact speed, stability, and storage. For example, tiny wheels excel in compact spaces but may struggle on rough terrain, while large wheels prioritize speed but reduce maneuverability.

>[!WARNING] Terrain-Specific Risks
> Spiked wheels and rugged designs may wear faster on dry surfaces or require maintenance to prevent damage. Always test wheel types in target environments before full-scale deployment.
