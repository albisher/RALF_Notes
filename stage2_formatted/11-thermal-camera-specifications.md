## Summary

```
Document detailing thermal camera sensor specifications, applications, and capabilities for passive heat detection.
```

## Details

> This document outlines key specifications of thermal cameras, including spectral ranges (LWIR/MWIR), resolution (160×120 to 1920×1080), frame rates (30–1000 Hz), thermal sensitivity (NETD), temperature ranges (-40°C to +2000°C), and accuracy (±0.5°C to ±2%). It categorizes applications by domain (e.g., search and rescue, firefighting, agriculture) and provides sensor-specific details like resolution, FOV, and weight for the FLIR Vue Pro R.

## Key Functions

### `Spectral Range Analysis`

Defines detection bands (LWIR 8–14 µm, MWIR 3–8 µm) for passive/active heat imaging.

### `Resolution Scaling`

Compares pixel counts (160×120 to 1920×1080) for varying application needs.

### `Frame Rate Optimization`

Matches speed (30–1000 Hz) to dynamic use cases (e.g., real-time monitoring).

### `NETD Sensitivity`

Explains how lower NETD (<20 mK) improves temperature precision.

### `Temperature Accuracy`

Classifies precision (±0.5°C to ±2%) by application tier.

### `Field of View (FOV)`

Adjusts lens options (6.8 mm to telephoto) for wide/narrow coverage.

### `Sensor Comparison`

Lists FLIR Vue Pro R specs (e.g., 640×512 resolution, 69° FOV) for practical deployment.

## Usage

Refer for selecting thermal cameras by resolution, sensitivity, or FOV for applications like SAR, firefighting, or industrial monitoring. Compare sensor specs (e.g., FLIR Vue Pro R) to match hardware with requirements.

## Dependencies

>[!INFO] Key Tradeoff
> **Resolution vs. Sensitivity**: Higher resolution (e.g., 1920×1080) may reduce NETD sensitivity, impacting temperature accuracy in low-light conditions.

>[!WARNING] Environmental Limits
> **Ultra-High-Temperature Range (up to +2000°C)**: Requires specialized sensors; standard models may fail beyond +550°C, risking data corruption or sensor damage.
