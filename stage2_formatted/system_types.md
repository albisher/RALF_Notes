## Summary

```
A categorized list of fundamental celestial system types in astronomy, detailing distinct star and planetary configurations.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates various **stellar and planetary systems**, categorizing them by their composition (e.g., single/multi-star systems) and orbital structures (e.g., debris disks, protoplanetary disks). Each entry represents a unique astronomical formation, critical for understanding galactic dynamics, planetary formation, and interstellar phenomena. The list spans from compact stellar objects (e.g., white dwarfs) to diffuse structures (e.g., globular clusters).

## Key Functions

### `Single Star System`

A system containing one star (e.g., our Solar System).

### `Binary Star System`

Two stars orbiting a common center of mass.

### `Triple Star System`

Three stars in a gravitationally bound configuration.

### `Multiple Star System`

Four or more stars in a bound system.

### `Planetary System`

Planets orbiting a star(s), including exoplanets.

### `Asteroid Belt System`

A ring of asteroids between planets (e.g., in our Solar System).

### `Kuiper Belt System`

A disk of icy bodies beyond Neptune.

### `Oort Cloud System`

A spherical shell of icy objects at the Solar System’s edge.

### `Protoplanetary Disk`

A rotating disk of gas/dust around a young star (future planetary system).

### `Debris Disk System`

A scattered ring of dust/rock around a star (e.g., from planet collisions).

### `Pulsar System`

A neutron star emitting periodic radio pulses.

### `White Dwarf System`

A small, dense remnant of a Sun-like star.

### `Brown Dwarf System`

A failed star (substellar object) with insufficient mass for fusion.

### `Rogue Planet System`

A planet not bound to a star (free-floating).

### `Interstellar Object`

A non-Solar System body (e.g., 'Oumuamua).

### `Globular Cluster`

A dense, spherical group of old stars.

### `Open Cluster`

A loose group of young stars (e.g., Pleiades).

### `Star Formation Region`

A cloud of gas/dust where stars are born.

### `Stellar Association`

A loose group of young, hot stars (e.g., Sco-Cen).

### `Moving Group`

A group of stars sharing common motion through space.

### `Circumstellar Disk`

A disk of material orbiting a star (distinct from protoplanetary disks).

## Usage

This list serves as a foundational reference for astronomers, planetary scientists, and space exploration researchers. It can be used to:
- Classify observed celestial systems.
- Design observational campaigns (e.g., searching for debris disks).
- Study stellar evolution and planetary formation.
- Develop models for interstellar dynamics.

>[!INFO] Contextual Note
> These systems are found across galaxies, with some (e.g., globular clusters) being ancient relics, while others (e.g., protoplanetary disks) are transient. The **Oort Cloud** and **Kuiper Belt** are critical for understanding Solar System dynamics and interstellar object origins.

>[!WARNING] Overlap Warning
> Terms like "disk" (e.g., protoplanetary vs. circumstellar) or "cluster" (globular vs. open) can overlap; context (e.g., age, composition) resolves ambiguities. Avoid conflating a **star formation region** with a **stellar association**—the former is a birthplace, the latter a loose group of newborn stars.
