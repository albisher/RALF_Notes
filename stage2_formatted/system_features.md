## Summary

```
A catalog of key celestial and planetary features influencing habitability and dynamics in space systems.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates critical **environmental and dynamical features** of planetary systems, stellar environments, and interstellar media. These elements define regions where planets form, evolve, or interact—critical for understanding planetary stability, habitability, and cosmic phenomena. Features span from **localized structures** (e.g., asteroid belts, rings) to **broad astrophysical processes** (e.g., solar winds, coronal mass ejections).
> 
> The list covers:
> - **Planetary system components** (e.g., rings, moons, debris disks).
> - **Stellar influences** (e.g., flares, winds, magnetic fields).
> - **Dynamical interactions** (e.g., tidal forces, resonances, Lagrange points).

## Key Functions

### `Habitable Zone`

Defines the region around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet’s surface.

### `Asteroid Belt`

A disk of rocky debris orbiting a star, influencing planetary collisions and material distribution.

### `Protoplanetary Disk`

Rotating disk of gas/dust around a young star, where planets form.

### `Circumstellar Material`

General leftover material (e.g., dust, gas) orbiting a star, affecting planet formation and evolution.

### `Lagrange Points`

Positions in an orbital system where gravitational forces balance, enabling stable orbits for objects (e.g., Trojan asteroids).

## Usage

This file serves as a **reference for planetary scientists, astrophysicists, or engineers** designing models of exoplanetary systems, habitability assessments, or space missions. It can be cross-referenced with:
- **Stellar evolution** studies (e.g., flares, CMEs).
- **Dynamical simulations** (e.g., tidal forces, resonances).
- **Observational astronomy** (e.g., debris disks, rings).

>[!INFO] **Habitable Zone Context**
> The "habitable zone" is often misrepresented as a static band around a star. In reality, it varies with stellar type, luminosity, and planetary properties (e.g., greenhouse effects, albedo). For example, a tidally locked planet may have one side permanently in the zone.

>[!WARNING] **Debris Disk Misinterpretation**
> Debris disks alone do not guarantee a planet’s existence. They may also indicate **active planetesimal belts** or **dynamical clearing** (e.g., from a giant impact). Overinterpretation can lead to false exoplanet discoveries.
