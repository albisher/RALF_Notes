# biome_shallow_ocean_fruit_types

## Summary

```
Describes shallow ocean fruit types and their ecological roles in biome definitions.
```

## Details

> This file likely defines the types of "fruit" or organic matter found in shallow ocean biomes, such as Gelatinous Sacs and Gas-filled Bladders. These elements could represent floating or buoyant organic structures that contribute to marine ecosystems, potentially influencing navigation, food sources, or habitat dynamics in simulated or fictional environments.
> 
> The terms suggest adaptations to shallow marine conditions, where buoyancy and organic composition play key roles in ecological interactions.

## Key Functions

### `Gelatinous Sacs`

Buoyant, gelatinous structures that drift in shallow waters, possibly serving as food or shelter for marine organisms.

### `Gas-filled Bladders`

Lightweight, gas-filled organ-like formations that float, likely aiding in buoyancy or serving as a nutrient source.

## Usage

These terms would typically be referenced in biome definitions, ecological simulations, or narrative descriptions of shallow ocean environments to define organic matter types.

## Dependencies

> `none (standalone descriptive list)`

>[!INFO] Ecological Role
> These elements may represent natural phenomena like floating seaweed clusters, jellyfish colonies, or specialized marine plants adapted to shallow waters.

>[!WARNING] Context Sensitivity
> In a structured system (e.g., game/environment design), ensure these terms are assigned specific properties (e.g., buoyancy, toxicity, or interaction rules) to avoid ambiguity.
