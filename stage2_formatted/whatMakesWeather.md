# whatMakesWeather

## Summary

```
Explores factors influencing weather patterns, including atmospheric effects, power dynamics, spatial impact, and temporal duration.
```

## Details

> This document appears to outline conceptual elements influencing weather phenomena, likely in a scientific or speculative context. The notes suggest a breakdown of weather effects based on:
> 1. **Atmospheric conditions** (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure gradients).
> 2. **Power-related factors** (e.g., energy inputs like solar radiation or latent heat release).
> 3. **Geospatial variables** (e.g., latitude, topography, or proximity to water bodies).
> 4. **Temporal aspects** (e.g., duration of weather events, seasonal cycles).
> 
> The structure hints at a framework for categorizing weather systems by their underlying causes rather than detailed meteorological modeling.

## Key Functions

### `Atmospheric Effects`

Describes how physical forces (e.g., Coriolis, convection) shape weather patterns.

### `Power Dynamics`

Explores energy transfer (e.g., latent heat, solar input) driving weather systems.

### `Area Influence`

Highlights how spatial factors (e.g., land/water contrasts) modify weather behavior.

### `Days/Temporal Analysis`

Examines how weather persists or evolves over time (e.g., storm lifecycles).

## Usage

This appears to be a **theoretical reference** for:
- Researchers studying weather mechanics.
- Game designers modeling environmental systems.
- Educators explaining weather phenomena.

>[!INFO] Conceptual Framework
> This is a **high-level outline**, not a scientific model. For empirical data, consult meteorological sources (e.g., NOAA, IPCC reports).

>[!WARNING] Speculative Context
> If applied in a fictional or non-scientific setting (e.g., games), ensure alignment with intended physics/environmental rules. Over-simplification may lead to unrealistic outcomes.
