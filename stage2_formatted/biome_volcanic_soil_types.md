## Summary

```
Describes key volcanic soil types based on mineral composition, relevant for environmental and geological studies.
```

## Details

> This document categorizes volcanic soil types into **silicate-rich**, **metallic**, **crystalline**, and **radioactive** classifications, reflecting the dominant mineralogical and chemical properties derived from volcanic activity. These classifications are critical for understanding soil formation in volcanic regions, their potential toxicity, and ecological impacts. The terms likely relate to the composition of volcanic ash, lava, and associated deposits, which vary based on magma composition, cooling rates, and geological processes.

## Key Functions

### `Silicate-rich`

Describes soils dominated by silicate minerals (e.g., feldspar, quartz), common in basaltic and andesitic volcanic deposits.

### `Metallic`

Refers to soils containing significant metal oxides or sulfides (e.g., iron, titanium), often found in mafic or ultramafic volcanic rocks.

### `Crystalline`

Indicates soils with well-formed mineral crystals (e.g., plagioclase, pyroxene), typical of rapidly cooled lava flows or intrusive igneous bodies.

### `Radioactive`

Highlights soils with elevated levels of radioactive elements (e.g., uranium, thorium), often associated with granitic or pegmatitic volcanic sources.

## Usage

This classification is useful for:
- **Soil science**: Assessing fertility, nutrient availability, and contamination risks.
- **Environmental monitoring**: Evaluating volcanic ash dispersion and long-term ecological effects.
- **Resource extraction**: Identifying metallic or radioactive mineral deposits in volcanic terrains.

>[!INFO] Important Note
> These classifications are **qualitative** and may vary regionally. Field sampling (e.g., X-ray fluorescence) is recommended for precise mineralogical analysis.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Radioactive soils require careful handling due to potential health risks. Avoid direct contact with unprocessed volcanic deposits.
