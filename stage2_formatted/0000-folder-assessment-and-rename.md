# development-log-assessment

## Summary

```
Renames and documents the reassessment of a folder to better reflect its content.
```

## Details

> This document details the assessment of the `whats_working` folder, which was renamed to `development-log` due to its misleading name. The folder contained 132 markdown files categorized into completed fixes, investigations, implementations, verifications, and issue reports.

### `Content Analysis`
