# soil_types

## Summary

```
Lists and categorizes distinct soil and growth medium types based on chemical and physical properties.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates various soil and cultivation medium classifications, distinguishing between natural soil types (e.g., silicate-rich, organic-rich) and synthetic or specialized systems (e.g., hydroponic, aeroponic). These categories reflect differences in nutrient composition, mineral content, and environmental conditions required for plant growth or material analysis.

## Key Functions

### `Classification`

Defines soil/growth medium types by chemical/physical attributes.

### `Research Reference`

Provides foundational data for studies in agriculture, geology, or material science.

## Usage

This list serves as a reference for:
- Soil scientists analyzing mineral composition.
- Hydroponic/aeroponic growers selecting mediums.
- Environmental researchers studying radioactive or magnetic properties.

>[!INFO] Contextual Use
> These classifications are critical for determining plant suitability, contamination risks (e.g., radioactive/magnetic soils), and agricultural practices (e.g., organic vs. synthetic media).

>[!WARNING] Misclassification Risk
> Incorrect categorization (e.g., mixing silicate-rich and radioactive soils) may compromise safety or yield in agricultural or industrial applications. Always validate with expert input.
