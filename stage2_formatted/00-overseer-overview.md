## Summary

```
Provides an overview of the **Overseer** system—a production-ready drone designed for lightweight inspection and safety verification in facility cleaning.
```

## Details

> The **Overseer** is a modular, verified system for inspecting cleaned surfaces (e.g., windows) while actively deterring birds. It integrates a lightweight drone platform with specialized sensors and a bird deterrent mechanism to ensure quality control and safety compliance. The document confirms all components are current with 2024–2025 open-source best practices and references external research on drone benefits in facility management.

## Key Functions

### `Mission Profile`

Lightweight drone following climbers to verify cleaning quality and deter birds.

### `Platform Selection`

Core hardware/software choice for drone autonomy (linked to [01-platform-selection.md]).

### `Inspection Sensor Suite`

Equipment for quality verification (linked to [02-inspection-sensors.md]).

### `Bird Deterrent System`

Active measures to discourage bird interference (linked to [03-bird-deterrent.md]).

## Usage

Refer to linked modules for implementation details. The system is production-ready, validated against 2024–2025 standards.

## Dependencies

> `- External research papers (e.g.`
> `Polarsens camera technology`
> `drone benefits in facility management).
- Linked documentation modules (e.g.`
> `[01-platform-selection.md]`
> `[02-inspection-sensors.md]).`

>[!INFO] **Verification Status**
> All components are verified with current open-source alternatives and best practices, ensuring compliance with 2024–2025 standards.

>[!WARNING] **Mission Scope**
> The drone’s lightweight design prioritizes inspection accuracy but may be limited by environmental factors (e.g., wind, bird density). Test conditions should account for real-world variability.
