## Summary

```
A detailed hash-based world simulation of a robotic colony, documenting characters, robotic assets, buildings, and plant ecosystems.
```

## Details

> This document describes a **hash-based world (w23)** as a colony with 34 total assets, including human characters, robotic bodies, buildings, and surrounding flora. Characters are assigned specialized roles (e.g., engineering, medical, security) with associated traits, locations, and stats. Robotic bodies are linked to characters, featuring distinct models, enhancement types, and power levels. Buildings are categorized by function (e.g., research, agriculture) with specifications like size, material, and energy efficiency. The environment includes diverse plant life (e.g., vines, grasses) with attributes like color, height, density, and oxygen production, all tied to specific locations within the colony’s levels.

## Key Functions

### `Character Profiles`

Tracks roles, stats, and locations of human personnel (e.g., Alex Chen, Dr. Sarah Kim).

### `Robotic Body Integration`

Maps robotic enhancements to characters, detailing model types, power levels, and special features.

### `Building Architecture`

Classifies colony structures by function, size, and efficiency metrics.

### `Biomechanical Environment`

Organizes plant ecosystems by location, type, and ecological impact (oxygen production).

## Usage

This document serves as a **colony management reference** for tracking assets, assigning roles, and monitoring environmental interactions. Useful for:
- **Operations planning** (e.g., assigning robotic bodies to tasks).
- **Resource allocation** (e.g., energy efficiency of buildings).
- **Ecological monitoring** (e.g., oxygen production from plants).

>[!INFO] **Hash-Based Tracking**
> Each character, robot, and asset is uniquely identified via cryptographic hashes, enabling decentralized data management and redundancy in colony systems.

>[!WARNING] **Energy Overload Risk**
> Buildings with >100% energy efficiency (e.g., Advanced Research Complex) may indicate inefficiencies or unintended power draw—requires audits to prevent system strain.
