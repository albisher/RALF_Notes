## Summary

```
Defines a categorized list of planetary surface and atmospheric types for fictional or scientific planetary classification.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates distinct planetary types, likely used in fictional or scientific contexts (e.g., tabletop games, sci-fi settings, or space exploration simulations). Each entry represents a unique composition, climate, or environmental characteristic of a planet, such as surface materials (e.g., crystalline or molten) or atmospheric gases (e.g., helium or methane). The list appears to be structured for classification, resource assessment, or thematic design in planetary science or storytelling.

## Key Functions

### `Planetary Classification`

Categorizes planets by their physical or atmospheric properties for narrative, modeling, or research.

### `Resource/Environmental Tagging`

Assigns descriptive tags to planets for thematic or gameplay purposes (e.g., "Radioactive" for hazardous environments).

## Usage

This list is typically referenced in:
- **Game Design**: Assigning traits to planets in tabletop or video games (e.g., "Molten" for lava-based gameplay).
- **Science Fiction Writing**: Describing alien worlds with unique compositions (e.g., "Helium" for a gas-giant atmosphere).
- **Space Simulation**: Defining environmental variables for procedural planet generation.
- **Data Systems**: Populating databases or APIs for planetary metadata.

>[!INFO] Contextual Use
> These types may be expanded into full descriptions (e.g., "Molten" includes lava oceans, volcanic storms, or extreme temperatures) for richer storytelling or technical modeling.

>[!WARNING] Ambiguity
> Some terms (e.g., "Oceanic") could overlap with terrestrial planets; clarify distinctions (e.g., "Oceanic" = liquid water vs. "Terrestrial" = solid surface).
