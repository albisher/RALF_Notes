# biome_tundra_height_categories

## Summary

```
Defines height category labels for tundra biomes based on vegetation growth.
```

## Details

> This file appears to be a simple enumeration of height categories used to classify vegetation or environmental features in tundra biomes. The values `tiny` and `short` likely represent discrete growth stages or size classes (e.g., "tiny" for dwarf shrubs, "short" for low-growing grasses). These labels may be used in ecological studies, climate modeling, or vegetation mapping to categorize plant communities or soil/vegetation profiles.

## Key Functions

### ``tiny``

Represents the smallest vegetation class in tundra ecosystems (e.g., lichens, mosses, or very short shrubs).

### ``short``

Represents a slightly taller vegetation class (e.g., low-growing sedges, heather, or small woody plants).

## Usage

This file is likely a reference or lookup table for:
- **Ecological modeling**: Assigning vegetation height categories to datasets.
- **Climate research**: Categorizing tundra vegetation for remote sensing or field studies.
- **Database schemas**: Structuring data for tundra biome studies (e.g., as enum values in a database).

>[!INFO] Contextual Use
> These categories may align with broader tundra classification systems (e.g., Arctic tundra vs. alpine tundra) and could be extended to include `medium`/`tall` for broader ecological studies.

>[!WARNING] Ambiguity Check
> Ensure `tiny`/`short` are unambiguous for your specific study—some tundra plants may blur these categories (e.g., prostrate shrubs). Clarify definitions if needed.
