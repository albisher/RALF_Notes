# 05_world_building_questions

## Summary

```
A structured guide for designing the lore, society, and conflicts of a sci-fi universe centered on humans, robots, and environmental themes.
```

## Details

> This document outlines key questions for developing a cohesive world-building framework, addressing themes like lore depth, societal dynamics, technology, and cultural traditions. It serves as a checklist for balancing historical context, technological details, and interpersonal relationships between species while addressing existential challenges (e.g., adaptation to a blue sun).

## Key Functions

### `Space Peral Universe`

Defines narrative scope (current vs. historical) and thematic emphasis (e.g., blue sun effects).

### `Robot Society & Culture`

Guides faction design, personality depth, and creation myths for AI entities.

### `Human-Robot Interaction`

Explores coexistence, dependency, and conflict resolution dynamics.

### `Environmental Adaptation`

Maps biological/technological responses to the blue sun and ecological pressures.

### `Cultural Traditions`

Curates rituals, art, and heritage preservation to reflect societal identity.

## Usage

Act as a brainstorming tool for writers/designers to:
1. Prioritize lore elements (e.g., focus on robot factions vs. human-robot tensions).
2. Balance conflicts (e.g., X9’s role) with reconciliation narratives.
3. Integrate technology (e.g., GPS, energy systems) into cultural fabric.

## Dependencies

> `None (standalone thematic framework for narrative development).`

>[!INFO] **Lore vs. Action**: Questions 1–4 and 25–28 prioritize *lore depth* over gameplay mechanics, ensuring narrative consistency.
> *Example*: Emphasizing blue sun effects (Q3) may require environmental adaptations (Q29–32) to avoid contradictions.

>[!WARNING] **Avoid Over-Specification**: Questions like 13–16 (technology) risk becoming "how-to" manuals; keep details thematic (e.g., "GPS as a cultural artifact").
> *Risk*: Over-detailed tech may overshadow human-robot dynamics (Q9–12).
