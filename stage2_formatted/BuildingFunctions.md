>[!INFO] Standardization Note
> These categories align with common international and regional building classification systems (e.g., **NAICS, OECD, or local municipal codes**). Ensure consistency with local or sector-specific standards when applying this list.

>[!WARNING] Overlap Risk
> Some categories (e.g., **community center** or **art gallery**) may overlap with residential/commercial zones. Clarify functional intent to avoid zoning conflicts.
