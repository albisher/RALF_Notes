# facial_features

## Summary

```
Describes common facial feature classifications used in facial recognition, aesthetics, or biometric analysis.
```

## Details

> This file categorizes and lists distinct facial features, which are fundamental in facial recognition systems, facial analysis, and aesthetic evaluations. Features are grouped into broad categories like jaw shape, facial contours, and eye/cheek attributes, helping identify physical traits for applications in biometrics, facial modeling, or facial recognition algorithms.

## Key Functions

### `Facial Contour Analysis`

Classifies jaw and face shapes (e.g., angular, round, square).

### `Biometric Identification`

Supports facial recognition systems by defining measurable traits (e.g., high cheekbones, prominent nose).

### `Aesthetic Evaluation`

Provides reference points for facial aesthetics (e.g., heart-shaped face, dimples).

## Usage

This list is typically used as a reference for:
- Training facial recognition algorithms.
- Facial feature extraction in computer vision.
- Facial modeling or 3D reconstruction.
- Anthropometric studies or biometric databases.

>[!INFO] Standardization Note
> Features should be standardized for consistency across datasets (e.g., "Strong Jawline" vs. "Sharp Jawline" may vary slightly in measurement thresholds).

>[!WARNING] Context Sensitivity
> Some features (e.g., "Dimples," "Scar on Cheek") are subjective and may require additional metadata for reliable classification.
