## Summary

```
A categorized list of stellar and binary systems, clusters, and phenomena relevant to stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates various classifications of celestial objects and phenomena associated with stars, including their configurations (e.g., solitary, binary, or clustered systems) and dynamic stages (e.g., remnants of stellar evolution). The entries cover fundamental stellar structures like **binary systems** (two stars orbiting each other) and **triple/multiple systems** (three or more stars), as well as exotic objects like **binary pulsars** (neutron stars in binary orbits) and **cataclysmic variables** (accreting binary systems). It also includes **stellar clusters** (e.g., globular/open clusters) and regions of star formation (e.g., **stellar nurseries**), highlighting key astrophysical processes.

## Key Functions

### `Solitary Star`

A single star not bound to another.

### `Binary System`

Two stars orbiting a common center of mass.

### `Triple System`

Three stars in a gravitational relationship.

### `Multiple Star System`

Four or more stars in a bound system.

### `Circumbinary Planets`

Planets orbiting a binary star system.

### `Stellar Cluster`

Group of stars bound by gravity (globular/open clusters).

### `Globular Cluster`

Dense, old cluster of stars.

### `Open Cluster`

Looser, younger star group.

### `Stellar Formation Region`

Site of new star birth (e.g., nebulae).

### `Binary Pulsar`

Neutron star + companion in a binary.

### `Cataclysmic Variable`

Accreting binary with extreme mass transfer.

### `Nova System`

Explosive binary star event.

### `Supernova Remnant`

Debris from a supernova explosion.

### `Planetary Nebula`

Expanding shell of gas ejected by a dying star.

## Usage

This list serves as a reference for astronomers, researchers, and educators studying stellar dynamics, exoplanet systems, or galactic evolution. Useful for:
- Defining terms in papers/presentations.
- Categorizing observations (e.g., classifying a binary system).
- Contextualizing star formation or death phases.

>[!INFO] Key Distinction
> **Globular vs. Open Clusters**: Globular clusters are older, denser, and spherical; open clusters are younger, less compact, and often found in spiral arms.

>[!WARNING] Misclassification Risk
> Misidentifying a **binary system** as a solitary star can lead to incorrect orbital mechanics or mass estimates in studies. Always verify observational data.
