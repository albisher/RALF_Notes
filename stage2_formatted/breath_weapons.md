>[!INFO] Important Note
> These breath weapons are often **elemental or thematic**—e.g., "Fire Breath" may imply a connection to fire-based lore, while "Plant Growth Breath" suggests a link to nature or botanical themes. Some effects (e.g., "Time Slow Breath") may interact with mechanics like turn-based combat or time-based systems.


>[!WARNING] Caution
> Certain weapons (e.g., **Poisonous Gas Breath**, **Energy Drain Breath**) could have **negative consequences** if overused, such as depleting HP or triggering counterattacks. Always balance effects to avoid unplayable conditions.
