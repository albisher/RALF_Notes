## Summary

```
Document outlining regulatory compliance requirements for drone operations, emphasizing FAA, safety, and international standards with open-source alternatives.
```

## Details

> This document outlines regulatory compliance requirements for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), focusing on U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, safety standards, and international regulations. It highlights critical waivers (e.g., Part 107, BVLOS) and compliance mandates (e.g., detect-and-avoid systems, parachute certification). The text also notes regional variations and emphasizes the need for verification of current specifications, waiver procedures, and compliance documentation. Open-source alternatives for compliance tools, documentation, and audit trails are identified as research priorities.

## Key Functions

### `FAA Waiver Requirements`

Documentation of Part 107, BVLOS, and swarm operations compliance.

### `Safety Standards Validation`

ASTM F3322-18, ISO 21384-3, and IEC 60529 compliance checks.

### `International Compliance`

Country-specific and cross-border regulatory mapping.

### `Open-Source Research`

Identification of open-source tools for compliance documentation, flight logging, and audit trails.

## Usage

This document serves as a reference for drone operators, engineers, and compliance teams to ensure adherence to regulatory and safety requirements. It should be cross-referenced with current FAA updates and regional regulations for accuracy.
