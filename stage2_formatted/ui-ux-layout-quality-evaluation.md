>[!INFO] Important Note
> The sidebar's fixed width (`360px`) may cause usability issues on smaller screens. Implement responsive adjustments (e.g., `25%` viewport width) to ensure accessibility.


>[!WARNING] Caution
> Visualization components may fail to render due to missing data synchronization or incorrect rendering logic. Verify backend/API integration for real-time updates.
