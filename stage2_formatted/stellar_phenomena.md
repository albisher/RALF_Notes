## Summary

```
A catalog of key stellar and cosmic phenomena influencing stellar evolution, energy output, and observable space events.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates fundamental stellar and astrophysical processes, including explosive events, continuous emissions, and dynamic interactions. Phenomena like **nuclear fusion** and **helium flash** drive stellar energy production, while **magnetic reconnection** and **coronal mass ejections (CMEs)** release stored magnetic energy. **Accretion disks** and **binary transfer** describe mass exchange in close stellar systems, whereas **supernova precursors** and **gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)** mark catastrophic end-stages of stellar evolution. **Gravitational waves** and **time dilation** highlight relativistic effects, while **tidal forces** and **plasma jets** illustrate interactions with surrounding environments. These phenomena collectively shape stellar lifecycles, interstellar medium dynamics, and observable cosmic signatures.

## Key Functions

### `Nuclear Fusion`

Converts hydrogen into helium, releasing energy via proton-proton chain or CNO cycle.

### `Helium Flash`

Sudden fusion ignition in degenerate helium cores of low-mass stars, bypassing the red giant phase.

### `Carbon Burning`

Fusion of carbon into heavier elements (e.g., neon, oxygen) in advanced stellar cores.

### `Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)`

Extremely luminous, transient explosions from collapsars (black hole formation) or mergers.

### `Accretion Disks`

Rotating disks of gas/matter spiraling into compact objects (e.g., neutron stars, black holes).

### `Tidal Forces`

Gravitational stretching of celestial bodies, influencing orbits, star formation, and mergers.

### `Gravitational Waves`

Ripples in spacetime from asymmetric mass distributions (e.g., binary mergers, supernovae).

### `Time Dilation`

Relativistic redshift effect due to proximity to massive objects or high velocities.

## Usage

This file serves as a reference for:
- **Astrophysicists** studying stellar evolution, high-energy astrophysics, or gravitational dynamics.
- **Cosmologists** analyzing cosmic events (e.g., GRBs, supernovae) and their propagation.
- **Space missions** (e.g., LIGO, Chandra, Fermi) interpreting observational data.
- **Educational contexts** explaining stellar lifecycle stages or relativistic phenomena.

>[!INFO] **Stellar Lifecycle Context**
> Many phenomena (e.g., **carbon burning**, **helium flash**) are stage-specific in stellar evolution, from main sequence to white dwarf/neutron star phases.

>[!WARNING] **Observational Challenges**
> Events like **GRBs** or **CMEs** are rare and require targeted observations (e.g., telescopes, satellites) to detect. Misidentification risks occur without context (e.g., distinguishing a CME from a solar flare).
