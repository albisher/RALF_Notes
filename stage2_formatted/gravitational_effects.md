## Summary

```
Documentation of key gravitational phenomena and concepts in general relativity, covering classical and advanced effects.
```

## Details

> This file outlines foundational and advanced gravitational effects, including classical gravity, relativistic phenomena, and extreme cosmic behaviors. It covers both observable effects (e.g., gravitational waves, lensing) and theoretical constructs (e.g., singularities, ergospheres). The content serves as a reference for gravitational dynamics, from weak-field approximations to extreme spacetime distortions near black holes.

## Key Functions

### `Standard Gravity`

Newtonian approximation of gravitational force (F = G·m₁·m₂/r²).

### `Strong Pull`

Describes extreme gravitational fields near massive objects (e.g., black holes).

### `Weak Field`

Relativistic corrections to Newtonian gravity (e.g., post-Newtonian expansions).

### `Variable Force`

Gravitational variations due to motion or dynamic mass distributions.

### `Tidal Distortion`

Gravitational stretching of objects in non-uniform fields (e.g., near black holes).

### `Gravitational Waves`

Ripples in spacetime from accelerating masses (detectable via LIGO).

### `Space-time Curvature`

Metric distortion around massive objects (Einstein’s general relativity).

### `Orbital Resonance`

Gravitational interactions causing synchronized orbital motion (e.g., Jupiter’s influence on asteroids).

### `Lagrange Points`

Equilibrium positions in orbital mechanics (e.g., Earth-Moon system).

### `Gravitational Lensing`

Bending of light by massive objects (e.g., galaxy clusters).

### `Frame Dragging`

Spacetime rotation due to angular momentum (e.g., near rotating black holes).

### `Geodetic Precession`

Slow drift of spacetime paths in curved fields (e.g., GPS corrections).

### `Time Dilation`

Relativistic slowing of time near strong gravity (e.g., GPS satellites).

### `Redshift Effects`

Gravitational redshift of light escaping strong fields.

### `Blueshift Zones`

Rare regions where light gains energy (e.g., near accretion disks).

### `Escape Velocity`

Minimum speed to break free from a gravitational field.

### `Event Horizons`

Boundary of black holes (point of no return).

### `Singularity Formation`

Infinite density/curvature at black hole centers.

### `Schwarzschild Radius`

Event horizon radius for non-rotating black holes (Rₛ = 2GM/c²).

### `Ergosphere`

Region around rotating black holes where spacetime drags outwards.

### `Photon Sphere`

Orbit of photons near supermassive black holes (unstable circular paths).

This file serves as a conceptual reference for:
- Researchers studying gravitational physics.
- Engineers designing spacecraft navigation (e.g., orbital mechanics, relativistic corrections).
- Educators teaching general relativity or astrophysics.
- Analysts modeling extreme cosmic phenomena (e.g., black hole mergers).

>[!INFO] Key Distinction
> Newtonian gravity (Standard Gravity) fails at extreme scales (e.g., black holes), where general relativity (e.g., Schwarzschild Radius) is necessary. This file bridges both frameworks.


>[!WARNING] Singularity Warning
> Singularities (e.g., in black holes) remain unobservable due to causality—no information escapes their event horizons. Theories like quantum gravity may resolve them, but current physics treats them as mathematical limits.
