## Summary

```
Explores how drones and low-space orbiters detect metals and other resources using advanced sensor technologies, comparing electromagnetic induction-based methods with remote sensing techniques.
```

## Details

> This document analyzes metal detection methods for drones and low-space orbiters, highlighting key sensor technologies. Drones employ **electromagnetic induction sensors** (VLF, PI, time-domain detectors) to detect metals via induced eddy currents, while orbiters use **spectrometers, magnetometers, and radar** to analyze elemental composition and subsurface structures remotely. Additional sensors like **LiDAR, multispectral/hyperspectral cameras, and infrared sensors** expand detection capabilities to other resources (minerals, vegetation, water). The table contrasts sensor types across platforms, emphasizing their detection principles and applications.

## Key Functions

### `Electromagnetic Induction Sensors (VLF, PI, Time-Domain)`

** Detect metals via induced eddy currents in conductive materials.

### `Magnetometers`

** Identify ferrous metals and planetary magnetic anomalies.

### `Spectrometers (X-ray/Gamma-ray)`

** Analyze elemental composition via spectral analysis.

### `LiDAR`

** Maps terrain and vegetation structure via laser pulse timing.

### `Multispectral/Hyperspectral Cameras`

** Differentiate minerals and vegetation based on reflected light wavelengths.

### `Radar/GPR`

** Penetrates subsurface for hidden structures (e.g., buried metals, water).

## Usage

- **Drones:** Deployed for **surface metal prospecting** (e.g., archaeological, mining) or **environmental monitoring** (e.g., pollution detection).
- **Orbiters:** Used for **planetary science** (e.g., Mars mineral mapping) or **resource exploration** (e.g., asteroid mining).
- **Hybrid Systems:** Combine sensors (e.g., drone + LiDAR + hyperspectral) for multi-purpose surveys.

## Dependencies

> `- Electromagnetic theory (for induction-based sensors)
- Remote sensing algorithms (for orbital data processing)
- LiDAR/optical sensor hardware (for drone/orbiter integration)
- Geophysical modeling (for magnetometer/radar interpretation)`

>[!INFO] **Key Limitation of Magnetometers**
> Magnetometers excel at detecting **ferrous metals** but struggle with discrimination (e.g., distinguishing iron from nickel). Their resolution is lower than induction sensors for non-ferrous metals.

>[!WARNING] **Orbital Resolution Trade-offs**
> While orbiters provide **broad-area coverage**, their sensors (e.g., spectrometers) lack the **high spatial resolution** of drone-based systems, limiting fine-scale metal detection.
