>[!INFO] Cultural Nuance
> Arabic terms like **"منشئ"** (Munshi') and **"حكايات"** (Hikayat) carry traditional weight, emphasizing storytelling and craftsmanship. Avoid overly religious connotations (e.g., "خالق") unless explicitly intended for a specific audience.

>[!WARNING] Localization Pitfalls
> Ensure translations in JSON files (e.g., `ar.json`) are grammatically correct and idiomatic. Misplaced words or awkward phrasing can confuse users. Test names in Arabic dialects if targeting regional markets.
