## Summary

```
Explores factors defining planetary characteristics and plant attributes for worldbuilding in science fiction or ecological studies.
```

## Details

> This document outlines key attributes influencing planet classification and planetary flora, including physical (size, atmosphere) and biological (biome, flora) properties. It categorizes plant characteristics into visual, functional, and aesthetic traits, such as growth patterns, colors, and adaptations, to generate diverse ecosystems.

## Key Functions

### `Planet Classification`

Determines planet suitability via size, sun color, and atmosphere.

### `Flora Generation`

Structured approach to defining plant traits (e.g., leaf shapes, colors) based on environmental inputs.

### `Biome Mapping`

Links planetary conditions to biome-specific flora (e.g., desert vs. rainforest plants).

## Usage

1. Apply **planet factors** (size, sun color, atmosphere) to define environmental constraints.
2. Use **flora attributes** (e.g., growth rate, defense mechanisms) to generate unique plant designs.
3. Combine with biome properties to create cohesive ecosystems for storytelling or simulations.

>[!INFO] Environmental Dependency
> Plant traits (e.g., leaf density, root systems) must align with atmospheric pressure, temperature, and radiation levels to ensure realism.

>[!WARNING] Overlap Risk
> Avoid redundant traits (e.g., "fast growth" + "slow growth")—prioritize mutually exclusive categories (e.g., deciduous vs. evergreen) to prevent inconsistencies.
