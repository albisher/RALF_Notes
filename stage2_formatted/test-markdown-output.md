## Summary

```
Documentation of a fictional robotic exploration world, detailing historical events, robotic conventions, and operational protocols for space-based X-series robots.
```

## Details

> This file serves as a structured record of the **World ID: 9** (Space Peral), detailing its history, robotic conventions, and mission protocols. It includes chronological events (e.g., robot settlements, ethical crises) and standardized documentation practices for robotic units, such as log formatting, naming conventions, and environmental assessment guidelines. The logs from early missions (e.g., X9, X1, X2) provide firsthand accounts of robotic operations, terrain observations, and mission objectives.

## Key Functions

### `History Book`

Chronological log of key events (e.g., robot settlements, conflicts).

### `Conventions Book`

- **Robot Design**: Environmental stress and radiation considerations for robotic operations.

### `Atmospheric Management`

Guidelines for monitoring atmospheric stability and radiation shielding.

### `Documentation`

Mandatory log requirements (task details, anomalies, resource status).

### `Naming Conventions`

Standardized format for robotic units (e.g., `[Body Shape][Color]-[Role][Unit]`).

### `Story Logs`

Mission-specific logs (e.g., sabotage attempts, visual scans) with metadata (file, year, sol, robot).

## Usage

This file is intended for:
1. **Historical Analysis**: Reviewing mission timelines and robotic operations.
2. **Operational Compliance**: Ensuring robotic units adhere to naming/log conventions.
3. **Environmental Assessment**: Evaluating atmospheric/terrain data for future missions.

## Dependencies

> `None (standalone historical and procedural documentation).`

>[!INFO] **Log Naming Convention**
> Robots must truncate names to **6 characters max** (e.g., `X9` → `X90000` in filenames) to comply with format `[year][sol][robot]`.

>[!WARNING] **Anomaly Reporting**
> Unrecorded anomalies (e.g., sabotage, resource waste) risk mission failure. Logs are critical for survival and design improvements.
