## Summary

```
Compares commercial vs. open-source hardware/software costs for drone development, highlighting cost savings and timeline planning.
```

## Details

> This document evaluates hardware and software expenses for drone systems, contrasting commercial and open-source options. It outlines budget breakdowns for components like drones, LiDAR, cameras, and ground stations, emphasizing cost reductions (51-54%) with open-source alternatives. The timeline details phased development (Months 1-12) for hardware procurement, software integration, field trials, and regulatory approvals. Key considerations include feasibility, resource allocation, and risk mitigation.

## Key Functions

### `Cost Comparison`

Evaluates total system costs between commercial and open-source platforms.

### `Timeline Planning`

Defines development phases (e.g., Months 4-6 for ROS2 integration).

### `Open-Source Research`

Identifies open-source tools (e.g., PX4, ROS2) to reduce costs and development time.

## Usage

Compare hardware/software costs to justify budget decisions, plan development phases, and explore open-source alternatives for cost efficiency.

## Dependencies

> `PX4/ArduPilot`
> `ROS2`
> `QGroundControl`
> `Open-Source LiDAR (Ouster OS1/OS2 or Livox)`
> `Open-Source Drone Frameworks`

>[!INFO] Important Note
> Open-source platforms (e.g., PX4, ROS2) eliminate software costs, saving $0-$7,000 annually, while hardware costs drop by ~$50,000.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Verify regulatory compliance (e.g., Part 107 waivers) and hardware feasibility before deployment. Risk factors include resource constraints and timeline delays.
