## Summary

```
A structured classification of a star system’s lifecycle stages from formation to dissolution.
```

## Details

> This file outlines the chronological phases of a star system, detailing its evolutionary progression from early protostellar stages through advanced stellar phases, culminating in dissolution. Each phase represents a key transition in the system’s structure, composition, and fate, reflecting both internal stellar processes and external cosmic influences.

## Key Functions

### `Proto-formation`

Initial collapse of interstellar gas and dust into a protostar.

### `Disk Formation`

Accretion disk around the young star, enabling planet formation.

### `Heavy Bombardment`

Period of intense asteroid/comet impacts post-planet formation.

### `Stellar Evolution`

Phases like Red Giant, White Dwarf, or Supernova driven by nuclear fusion.

### `System Dissolution`

Final collapse or dispersal of remnants (e.g., planetary nebula, stellar remnant).

## Usage

This taxonomy serves as a conceptual framework for:
- **Astrophysicists** studying stellar lifecycles.
- **Planetary scientists** analyzing system evolution.
- **Cosmologists** modeling galaxy formation and dynamics.

>[!INFO] Key Transition
> **Disk Formation** marks the birth of planetary systems; critical for habitable zones.

>[!WARNING] Unstable Phase
> **Heavy Bombardment** may erode atmospheres or disrupt young planets; variable duration (~400–1M years).
