## Summary

```
Describes climate classification for tropical forest biomes, focusing on key environmental conditions.
```

## Details

> This document outlines the typical climate characteristics of tropical forests, emphasizing warm temperatures, high humidity, and distinct seasonal patterns. Tropical forests thrive in regions with minimal seasonal variation, often defined by **Köppen climate classification** (e.g., *Af*—tropical rainforest) or **wet-dry cycles** (e.g., *Aw*—monsoon climate). Key factors include:
> - **Temperature**: Consistently high (avg. 24–28°C year-round).
> - **Precipitation**: High annual totals (1,500–2,500 mm), often concentrated in short wet seasons.
> - **Biodiversity**: Supports dense vegetation and endemic species due to stable conditions.

## Key Functions

### `Köppen Classification`

Categorizes tropical forests into *Af* (rainforest) or *Aw* (monsoon) based on precipitation patterns.

### `Climate Zones`

Defines latitudinal bands (e.g., near equator) where tropical forests dominate.

### `Seasonal Adaptation`

Explains how plants/animal species evolve to exploit wet/dry cycles.

## Usage

Referenced in ecological studies, conservation planning, or climate modeling to analyze tropical forest ecosystems. Useful for:
- Comparing biomes (e.g., rainforest vs. savanna).
- Assessing climate change impacts on biodiversity.

## Dependencies

> `none (theoretical/ecological concepts)`

>[!INFO] Key Term
> *Köppen System*: A global climate classification developed by Wladimir Köppen, grouping climates by temperature/precipitation (e.g., *Af* = no dry season).

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Overgeneralization: Tropical forests exhibit microclimates (e.g., canopy vs. understory) that vary locally; broad classifications may oversimplify diversity.
