## Summary

```
Classifies and lists stellar size categories used in astronomy for categorizing stars.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates various stellar size classifications, ranging from smallest (`Tiny`, `Micro`) to largest (`Colossal`, `Primordial`). These categories help astronomers and astrophysicists describe and compare star sizes, masses, and luminosities. The terms reflect evolutionary stages, mass distributions, and extreme cases in stellar physics.

## Key Functions

### `None`

This is a static reference list rather than executable code.

## Usage

Refer to this list when:
- Describing stellar properties in research papers or observations.
- Comparing star sizes in classification systems (e.g., spectral types).
- Documenting stellar evolution or mass ranges in astrophysics.

>[!INFO] Contextual Note
> These terms often overlap with broader classifications like **O-type stars** (massive) or **red giants** (giant/supergiant), but this file provides a broader, non-technical taxonomy for general reference.

>[!WARNING] Terminology Variability
> Some terms (e.g., `Compact`, `Ultra-Massive`) may vary by source; cross-check with authoritative sources (e.g., Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams) for precision.
