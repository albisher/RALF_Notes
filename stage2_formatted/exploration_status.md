# exploration_status

## Summary

```
Classifies exploration statuses for celestial or remote regions, used in space science and mapping systems.
```

## Details

> This list categorizes the level of exploration, mapping, or observation conducted on celestial bodies, systems, or regions. Each term represents a distinct stage of discovery, ranging from fully mapped systems to entirely unmapped or forbidden zones. These classifications are typically used in scientific research, space missions, or exploratory documentation to convey the extent of known data and exploration efforts.

## Key Functions

### `Classification`

Assigns a status label to describe the level of exploration or observation completeness.

### `Data Tracking`

Helps track progress in space exploration, research, or survey missions.

### `Risk Assessment`

Indicates whether an area is safe, restricted, or requires caution (e.g., "Forbidden Zone," "Quarantine Status").

## Usage

Used in:
- **Space Mission Reports**: To document progress of robotic or manned expeditions.
- **Scientific Research**: To categorize findings from telescopes, probes, or deep-space observations.
- **Exploration Logs**: To document regions requiring further study or investigation.
- **Risk Management**: To flag areas that may be hazardous or legally restricted.

>[!INFO] Important Note
> Terms like **"Manned Exploration"** and **"Robotic Missions"** imply active human or automated presence, while **"Unknown Territory"** or **"Forbidden Zone"** indicate high-risk or unexplored areas requiring careful assessment.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> **"Quarantine Status"** and **"Abandoned Settlement"** suggest potential biological or environmental hazards—avoid unauthorized access without proper protocols.
