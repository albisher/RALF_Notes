## Summary

```
Describes fruit type classifications for tropical forest biomes, categorizing them into structured groups.
```

## Details

> This document categorizes fruit types found in tropical forests into broad classifications, emphasizing their physical characteristics (e.g., berries, fleshy orbs, pods). The structure likely serves as a reference for ecological studies, biodiversity assessments, or ecological modeling, particularly in defining how fruits contribute to seed dispersal and ecosystem dynamics. The terms "clustered/singular," "crystalline/fibrous/metallic" suggest variations in morphology and potential adaptations (e.g., edibility, dispersal mechanisms).

## Key Functions

### `Berries (clustered/singular)`

Describes fruits that grow in clusters or individually, often fleshy and eaten by animals.

### `Fleshy Orbs`

Refers to spherical, fleshy fruits (e.g., tropical fruits like mangoes or passion fruits) adapted for animal consumption.

### `Pods (crystalline/fibrous/metallic)`

Classifies fruits resembling pods, with subcategories indicating structural traits (e.g., hard, fibrous, or metallic-like surfaces).

## Usage

This classification can be used in:
- **Ecological studies** to analyze fruit diversity and dispersal strategies.
- **Biodiversity inventories** for tropical forests.
- **Conservation planning** to identify key fruit-bearing species.
- **Botanical research** to study fruit adaptations.

>[!INFO] Ecological Relevance
> Fruits classified here often influence animal behavior (e.g., berries attract birds) and plant reproduction (e.g., pods disperse seeds via wind or animals).

>[!WARNING] Overlap Risk
> Some fruits (e.g., "fleshy orbs") may overlap with other categories; cross-referencing with field observations is recommended for accuracy.
