>[!INFO] Important Note
> **Critical Focus Areas**: Prioritize encryption for sensitive data and enforce strict credential management to prevent unauthorized access.
> **User Trust**: Transparency in data handling (e.g., logging policies) builds trust but requires balancing with privacy needs.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> **AI Risks**: Unsanitized data sent to AI services could expose creative work to unintended exposure or misuse. Implement strict sanitization workflows.
> **Legal Compliance**: Ensure policies align with GDPR/CCPA (or local laws) for data ownership and user consent.
