>[!INFO] **Artistic Style**
> The use of colored pencils creates a soft, textured finish, emphasizing a naive or illustrative approach rather than photorealism. This style is often associated with early sci-fi/fantasy visuals or hand-drawn concept art.

>[!WARNING] **Limited Color Palette**
> The restrained palette (reddish-brown, purple, greenish-grey) may limit versatility for digital adaptations or color grading. Consider expanding the palette for broader artistic flexibility.
