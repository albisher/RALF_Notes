## Summary

```
Describes key structural components of the Milky Way galaxy and broader galactic regions.
```

## Details

> This file outlines the primary regions and features of galactic structure, including central and peripheral components of galaxies like the Milky Way. It categorizes regions based on their spatial distribution, density, and function within the galaxy, such as star-forming zones, dark matter influences, and remnants of explosive events.

## Key Functions

### `Galactic Core`

Central supermassive black hole (Sagittarius A*) and dense star population.

### `Galactic Bulge`

Spherical distribution of older stars and globular clusters.

### `Spiral Arms`

Dense regions of star formation and molecular clouds.

### `Galactic Halo`

Extended, diffuse region containing dark matter and ancient globular clusters.

### `Galactic Disk`

Flat plane hosting stars, gas, and dust, including the **Inner Galaxy** and **Outer Rim**.

### `Perseus Arm/Sagittarius Arm`

Major spiral arms of the Milky Way, named after nearby constellations.

### `Star Formation Region/Stellar Nursery`

Dense molecular clouds where new stars form.

### `Dark Matter Halo`

Invisible mass influencing galaxy rotation and structure.

### `Globular Cluster Zone/Open Cluster Region`

Spherical clusters of old stars and loose star groups.

### `Molecular Cloud Complex`

Cold, dense gas clouds where stars are born.

### `Interstellar Medium`

Gas and dust between stars, including **Galactic Wind Region** (supernova-driven outflows).

### `Supernova Remnant Field`

Scattered remnants of exploded stars.

### `Black Hole Vicinity`

Regions around supermassive black holes (e.g., Sagittarius A*).

### `Void Regions`

Low-density intergalactic spaces between galaxies.

## Usage

This is a reference for astronomers, space scientists, or educators studying galactic dynamics, star formation, or large-scale cosmic structures. Useful for mapping galactic coordinates, interpreting observations, or designing simulations of galactic evolution.

>[!INFO] Key Distinction
> The **Galactic Disk** and **Halo** are distinct layers: the disk is flat and contains younger stars, while the halo is spherical and dominated by ancient globular clusters and dark matter.

>[!WARNING] Misconception Risk
> Terms like **"Inner Galaxy"** and **"Outer Rim"** can vary by source—some classify the **Galactic Bar** as part of the inner disk, while others treat it separately. Clarify definitions based on observational data.
