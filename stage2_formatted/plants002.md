## Summary

```
Explores terrestrial and aquatic biome plant adaptations, diversity, and ecological roles across diverse environments.
```

## Details

> This document categorizes plant life by biome type, detailing dominant species, key adaptations (e.g., water conservation, cold tolerance), and ecological impacts. Terrestrial biomes include deserts, forests, grasslands, tundra, and urban areas, while aquatic biomes cover ocean zones, coral reefs, and coastal waters. Adaptations vary by climate, soil, and disturbance factors, shaping biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

## Key Functions

### `Desert Plants`

Water-conserving adaptations (e.g., succulent storage, spiny leaves).

### `Tropical Forest Epiphytes`

Growth on canopies for light access.

### `Temperate Forest Deciduous Trees`

Seasonal leaf shedding for energy conservation.

### `Boreal Forest Conifers`

Evergreen needle leaves for cold resilience.

### `Grassland Plants`

Fire/grazing resistance via deep roots.

### `Tundra Plants`

Perennial growth with shallow roots for permafrost.

### `Coral Reef Zooxanthellae`

Symbiotic algae for nutrient exchange.

### `Volcanic Pioneer Species`

Lichens/mosses for soil formation.

## Usage

Compare biome-specific adaptations to study climate-driven evolution or design conservation strategies. Useful for ecology, botany, or environmental science research.

## Dependencies

>[!INFO] **Key Insight**
> Adaptations like deep roots in grasslands or symbiotic algae in coral reefs highlight how plants optimize survival in extreme or resource-limited environments.

>[!WARNING] **Limitation**
> Ice caps and deep ocean zones lack vascular plants due to physical barriers (cold, light absence), restricting study scope to microbes/algae.
