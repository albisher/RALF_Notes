# habitability

## Summary

```
Classifies planetary or environmental conditions into categories describing their suitability for life or human habitation.
```

## Details

> This file defines a structured categorization system for evaluating habitability, ranging from **fully habitable** environments (e.g., Earth-like conditions) to **completely uninhabitable** ones (e.g., toxic or radiation-dominated settings). Each term represents a distinct environmental or existential threat level, used in astrobiology, space exploration, or survival science to assess risks and resource requirements.
> 
> The categories are designed to reflect:
> - **Biological viability** (e.g., "Toxic to Life," "Atmospheric Poison").
> - **Physical constraints** (e.g., "Pressure Crushing," "Gravity Lethal").
> - **Psychological/perceptual hazards** (e.g., "Reality Unstable," "Memory Corrupting").
> - **Survival pragmatics** (e.g., "Protective Gear Required," "Emergency Shelter Only").

## Key Functions

### `Habitability Assessment`

Classifies environments by severity for life/survival.

### `Risk Mitigation Guidance`

Provides context for gear, adaptation, or emergency protocols.

### `Research Framework`

Supports studies in exoplanet habitability, space colonization, or extreme-environment survival.

## Usage

1. **Assign Labels**: Apply terms to planetary conditions (e.g., Mars = "Marginally Livable" with "Radiation Hazard").
2. **Risk Analysis**: Use in survival planning, mission planning, or scientific modeling.
3. **Comparative Studies**: Compare environments across habitability scales (e.g., "Terraformable" vs. "Extreme Conditions").

>[!INFO] **Term Scope**
> Each term is **not mutually exclusive**—e.g., a planet may have "Temperature Extremes" *and* "Pressure Crushing" simultaneously. Contextual analysis is required for accurate classification.

>[!WARNING] **Overlap Risks**
> Some categories (e.g., "Short-term Survivable" vs. "Adaptation Necessary") imply trade-offs. Overlapping hazards (e.g., "Toxic + Radiation") compound difficulty without protective measures.
