## Summary

```
Explores biome definitions, clustering methods, and classification criteria for land and water-based ecosystems.
```

## Details

> This document defines biomes as large geographic regions characterized by climate, vegetation, and animal life, categorized into terrestrial (land) and aquatic (water) types. Biome classification relies on climate data (temperature, precipitation), vegetation types, and secondary factors like soil/water characteristics. Terrestrial biomes include rainforests, grasslands, forests, deserts, and tundras, while aquatic biomes (e.g., oceans, lakes) use metrics like sea surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and ice fraction. Visualization occurs at regional/global scales, while local studies use finer ecosystem maps.

## Key Functions

### `Climate-based clustering`

Groups biomes using temperature/precipitation data.

### `Vegetation/soil mapping`

Defines biome boundaries via dominant plant types and soil traits.

### `Aquatic biome subdivision`

Classifies oceans by depth, temperature, and productivity (e.g., marine vs. freshwater).

### `Biome visualization`

Maps large-scale environmental zones (e.g., tundra, coral reefs).

## Usage

This document serves as a reference for:
- Ecologists studying biome distribution.
- Climate scientists modeling regional ecosystems.
- Cartographers creating biome maps (e.g., for conservation or research).

>[!INFO] **Terrestrial vs. Aquatic Distinction**
> Land biomes (e.g., deserts, forests) rely on surface-level factors, while aquatic biomes (e.g., coral reefs) depend on water chemistry and depth gradients.

>[!WARNING] **Scale Sensitivity**
> Biome boundaries are broad; local variations (e.g., microclimates) may override general classifications.
