### `None`

This is a static data file rather than executable code.

- Comparing real-world animal fur traits.
- Populating databases for wildlife studies.

>[!INFO] Scientific Context
> Many of these colors reflect adaptations like camouflage, insulation, or mating signals. For example, "Jet Black" may indicate high melanin for UV protection, while "Snow White" suggests thermal regulation in cold climates.

>[!WARNING] Ambiguity in Terms
> Some entries (e.g., "Ash Gray," "Tawny") are subjective and may vary by region or species. Always cross-reference with specialized sources for precise definitions.
