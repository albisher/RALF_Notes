# biome_volcanic_height_categories

## Summary

```
Defines volcanic height categories for biome classification in volcanic regions.
```

## Details

> This appears to be a simple, hardcoded classification system categorizing volcanic structures into three height-based tiers: **tiny**, **short**, and **medium**. Likely used to map or analyze volcanic features in environmental or geological studies, possibly for biome or ecosystem classification. The categories may correspond to relative elevation or structural prominence, though no additional context (e.g., thresholds or definitions) is provided in the snippet.

## Key Functions

### ``tiny``

Represents the smallest volcanic structures (e.g., maars, cinder cones with minimal elevation).

### ``short``

Intermediate-sized volcanic formations (e.g., stratovolcanoes with moderate height).

### ``medium``

Larger volcanic edifices (e.g., shield volcanoes or composite cones with significant elevation).

## Usage

This could be:
1. **Input for a classification algorithm** (e.g., machine learning model training).
2. **Reference data** for a GIS tool or biome mapping system.
3. **Hardcoded lookup table** in a script analyzing volcanic terrain.

>[!INFO] Contextual Note
> These categories may align with **USGS or IAVCEI (International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth’s Interior)** standards for volcanic cone classification, though exact thresholds are unspecified here.

>[!WARNING] Ambiguity Warning
> Without additional metadata (e.g., elevation thresholds or definitions), "tiny," "short," and "medium" are subjective. Clarification may be needed for precise applications.
