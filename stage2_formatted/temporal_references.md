## Summary

```
A structured list of advanced time and reference frames used in astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates key temporal and reference systems essential for celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and cosmological studies. It includes both Earth-based and cosmic time scales, such as calendar systems (Gregorian, Julian) and relativistic time concepts (Terrestrial Time, Barycentric Time). The entries cover fundamental epochs (e.g., *Redshift Epoch*, *Formation Time*) and theoretical constructs like *Cosmic Time* and *Light Travel Time*, critical for interpreting distant astronomical observations and modeling the universe’s evolution.

## Key Functions

### `Julian Date`

A continuous count of days since a reference point (no leap seconds).

### `Modified Julian Date`

An extension of Julian Date, incorporating leap seconds.

### `Gregorian Calendar`

The modern civil calendar used for Earth-based timekeeping.

### `Atomic Time`

High-precision timekeeping based on atomic transitions (e.g., UTC).

### `Terrestrial Time (TT)`

Time scale aligned with Earth’s rotation, used in astronomy.

### `Barycentric Time (TB)`

Time scale centered on the Sun’s barycenter, accounting for orbital motion.

### `Proper Time`

Time measured in a freely falling frame (general relativity).

### `Coordinate Time`

Time in a reference frame defined by coordinates (e.g., galactic coordinates).

### `Ephemeris Time`

Time scale used in celestial mechanics for orbital calculations.

### `Solar Time`

Time based on the Sun’s apparent motion (e.g., mean solar time).

### `Sidereal Time`

Time based on the Earth’s rotation relative to stars (≈23h56m).

### `Light Travel Time`

Delay due to the finite speed of light (e.g., for distant galaxies).

### `Lookback Time`

The time elapsed between an event and observation (e.g., light from a supernova).

### `Cosmic Time`

A hypothetical time scale for the universe’s expansion (e.g., Hubble time).

### `Age of Universe`

Estimated age (~13.8 billion years) based on cosmic microwave background data.

### `Redshift Epoch`

Time intervals defined by redshift values (e.g., *z=0* = present).

### `Formation Time`

Approximate time of the universe’s formation (Big Bang, ~13.8 Ga).

### `Observation Epoch`

Specific time frame for astronomical observations (e.g., Hubble Deep Field).

### `Current Era`

The current epoch in the cosmic timeline (e.g., *Holocene* on Earth, *Cosmic Dawn* in universe).

### `Future Projection`

Theoretical time scales beyond current observations (e.g., dark energy-driven expansion).

## Usage

This list serves as a reference for:
- Astronomers calibrating observations to cosmic time scales.
- Cosmologists modeling the universe’s evolution (e.g., redshift epochs).
- Engineers designing space missions (e.g., accounting for light travel time).
- Researchers interpreting data from distant galaxies or black holes.

>[!INFO] Important Note
> Terms like *Proper Time* and *Coordinate Time* require relativistic corrections; Earth-based clocks (e.g., UTC) differ significantly in space.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Misalignment between *Terrestrial Time (TT)* and *Atomic Time (UTC)* can cause errors in astronomical ephemerides; always use TT for precise celestial calculations.
