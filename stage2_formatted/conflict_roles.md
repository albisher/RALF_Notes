## Usage

This list can be used to:
- Assign roles in role-playing games (e.g., *Warhammer 40k*, *D&D*).
- Design conflict mechanics in simulations or strategy games.
- Analyze behavioral dynamics in historical or fictional conflicts.

>[!INFO] Role Overlap
> Some roles (e.g., *Diplomat* and *Negotiator*) may share functions but serve slightly different contexts (e.g., formal vs. informal negotiations).

>[!WARNING] Context-Dependence
> Roles like *Saboteur* or *Spy* require discretion; misassigning them could undermine conflict dynamics.
