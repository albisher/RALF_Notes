## Summary

```
A curated list of intrinsic human goals and motivations for personal and collective progress.
```

## Details

> This file outlines a structured set of **core human aspirations**, categorized under self-reflective, relational, and systemic motivations. The list emphasizes **purpose-driven behaviors** (e.g., wisdom gaining, justice serving) alongside **social and emotional goals** (e.g., trust earning, harmony creation). It serves as a framework for intentional living, aligning individual and collective values with broader ethical and existential objectives.

## Key Functions

### `Motivation Mapping`

Acts as a reference for identifying personal or organizational priorities.

### `Values Alignment`

Helps in designing systems (e.g., missions, policies) that reflect these foundational goals.

### `Self-Assessment Tool`

Encourages reflection on alignment with intrinsic drivers of action.

## Usage

- **Individual**: Use to guide decision-making, set intentions, or explore deeper meaning in daily life.
- **Organizational**: Apply as a foundation for mission statements, team values, or community-driven initiatives.
- **Cultural/Philosophical**: Integrate into discussions on ethics, psychology, or systemic change.

>[!INFO] **Contextual Nuance**
> While these goals are universally aspirational, their **prioritization** varies by culture, stage of life, or context (e.g., a warrior may emphasize strength building over peace making). Contextual adaptation is key.

>[!WARNING] **Overlap and Redundancy**
> Some goals (e.g., "trust earning" and "peace making") overlap; avoid conflating them. Clarify distinctions (e.g., trust is a *process*, peace is a *state*).
