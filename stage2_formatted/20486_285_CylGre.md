## Summary

```
Mission log documenting terrain mapping efforts in Space Peral’s western highlands, focusing on LIDAR-based data collection and anomaly detection.
```

## Details

> This log records the activities of **CylGre-Exp01**, a terrain-mapping unit in a two-person team tasked with creating a high-resolution topographical map of rugged, highland terrain. The mission encountered challenges like dense tree clusters (purplish foliage) causing LIDAR anomalies and unstable geological formations requiring red-tagging. Data is transmitted to Blue City for further spectral analysis to validate findings. The team aims to refine mapping resolution and develop filters for future scans.

## Key Functions

### `LIDAR sensor calibration`

Adjusting for dense foliage and mineral anomalies.

### `Anomaly detection`

Flagging unusual mineral traces and unstable terrain.

### `Data logging & transmission`

Recording and sending topographical data to Blue City.

### `Spectral analysis tools`

Assessing atmospheric haze and geological stability.

## Usage

This log documents operational procedures for terrain mapping missions, emphasizing real-time adjustments (e.g., resolution changes) and collaborative analysis with partners. Critical for resource planning and settlement in Space Peral.

## Dependencies

> `LIDAR sensors`
> `stereo cameras`
> `atmospheric particle filters`
> `Blue City data processing systems`
> `spectral analysis software.`

>[!INFO] Important Note
> The team’s current focus on LIDAR resolution adjustments is temporary; a full spectral analysis will confirm unstable terrain markings.

>[!WARNING] Caution
> Atmospheric haze limits stereo camera effectiveness—rely on LIDAR for critical scans. Unknown minerals may pose future risks; flag for further study.
