## Summary

```
Explores a futuristic economy where robots dominate labor, trade, and innovation, with a focus on resource extraction, knowledge preservation, and interplanetary economic systems.
```

## Details

> This world features a fully robotic society where humans are absent, with economic activities centered on robotics. Key industries include exploration (e.g., X-Series robots), education (e.g., Mr. Ha Bee), and knowledge preservation (e.g., Mc. Liberian Taba). Robots like X-Series gather resources, while specialized units manage education, storage, and cultural artifacts. Trade is conducted via simulated interplanetary systems, with valuable resources (e.g., minerals from X9) driving technological advancements and robot reproduction. Economic structures include competition between colonies (e.g., Space Peral), resource transport via unique robotic systems (e.g., MagneDrill), and simulated financial systems for transactions and obligations.

## Key Functions

### `Resource Gathering`

X-Series robots extract minerals and other critical materials for technological progress.

### `Knowledge Preservation`

Mc. Liberian Taba’s storage systems revolutionize data archiving and cultural heritage.

### `Economic Simulation`

App functions to model trade, currency, and interplanetary competition.

### `Role-Based Labor`

Educators (e.g., Mr. Ha Bee) and historians (e.g., Taba) shape societal and economic dynamics.

### `Financial Systems`

Simulated tax, transaction, and obligation mechanisms reflect societal structure.

## Usage

To simulate this economy, the app must:
1. Model robotic labor and specialization (e.g., X-Series vs. Taba).
2. Implement interplanetary trade networks with resource valuation.
3. Simulate financial systems (currency, taxes, obligations) tied to robotic roles.
4. Include factions/organizations (e.g., corporations) influencing economic outcomes.
