# body_types

## Summary

```
Describes a set of standardized body type categories for character design, aesthetics, or roleplaying systems.
```

## Details

> This file enumerates a curated list of **physical build descriptors** used to categorize human-like or humanoid characters in storytelling, gaming, or design contexts. Each term represents a distinct visual or functional archetype, often applied to define traits such as appearance, movement, or perceived strength. The list is structured for easy reference in creative projects requiring consistent body type definitions.

## Key Functions

### `Body Type Classification`

Assigns visual or narrative attributes to characters based on predefined archetypes.

### `Character Design Tool`

Provides a standardized vocabulary for describing physical traits in fiction, games, or roleplaying systems.

### `Aesthetic Reference`

Serves as a guide for artists, writers, or designers to ensure consistent body type representation.

## Usage

1. **Creative Writing/Storytelling**: Use these terms to describe character appearances or traits in narratives.
2. **Game Design**: Apply as attributes for character stats, visual models, or animations (e.g., "Powerful" may imply a "Stocky" build).
3. **Roleplaying Systems**: Assign body types to players or NPCs for thematic consistency (e.g., "Lanky" for a tall, slender figure).
4. **Art/Animation**: Reference these terms when defining character silhouettes, proportions, or movement styles.

>[!INFO] **Contextual Nuance**
> While these terms are broad, their application should align with broader narrative or functional goals (e.g., "Powerful" may imply "Stocky" but not necessarily "Wiry"). Cross-check with other body traits (e.g., "Graceful" often pairs with "Slender").

>[!WARNING] **Avoid Overgeneralization**
> Terms like "Average Build" or "Robust" can be subjective. For precision, pair with specific measurements (e.g., "Tall and Lean" = 6’2” with slender limbs) or supplementary descriptors (e.g., "Powerful" = "Stocky" + "Muscular").
