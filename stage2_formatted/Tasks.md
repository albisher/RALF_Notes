## Summary

```
A framework categorizing broad operational domains for structured planning across diverse missions.
```

## Details

> This file outlines a foundational categorization system for organizing high-level operational tasks into nine distinct domains. Each category—such as **Data Analysis** or **Security**—represents a critical functional area applicable across military, corporate, or governmental contexts. The structure enables modular task allocation, ensuring alignment with broader strategic objectives while allowing flexibility for specialized sub-tasks. The domains are designed to be mutually inclusive but not exhaustive, allowing for expansion (e.g., adding "Cyber Warfare" under Security) or refinement (e.g., splitting "Research" into "Technological" and "Strategic").

## Key Functions

### `Domain Mapping`

Assigns tasks to predefined categories for resource allocation.

### `Strategic Alignment`

Facilitates coherence between operational units and overarching goals.

### `Flexible Expansion`

Supports dynamic adjustments via subcategories or hybrid roles.

## Usage

1. **Application**: Use this taxonomy to define workflows, assign personnel, or allocate budgets across domains.
2. **Integration**: Combine with other systems (e.g., task-tracking software) to automate categorization.
3. **Refinement**: Customize labels (e.g., "Medical Assistance" → "Healthcare Support") for domain-specific needs.

>[!INFO] Contextual Adaptation
> This framework is agnostic to sector (military, corporate, etc.). Adapt labels (e.g., "Espionage" → "Intelligence") based on domain-specific terminology.

>[!WARNING] Overlap Risk
> Some domains (e.g., "Research" and "Diplomacy") may overlap. Clarify boundaries via subcategories or shared governance models.
