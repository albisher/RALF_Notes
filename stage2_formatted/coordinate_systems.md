## Summary

```
A comprehensive reference for various celestial coordinate systems used in astronomy and astrophysics.
```

## Details

> This file outlines multiple coordinate systems essential for describing positions, motions, and measurements in astronomy. Each system (e.g., Galactic, Equatorial, Heliocentric) serves distinct purposes in tracking celestial objects, their velocities, and spatial orientations relative to different reference frames. These systems are foundational for astrometry, kinematics, and observational astronomy, enabling precise localization and dynamic analysis of stars, galaxies, and other cosmic phenomena.

## Key Functions

### `Galactic Coordinates`

Defines positions in the Milky Way galaxy, using the galactic center as the origin.

### `Equatorial Coordinates`

Uses celestial equator and right ascension/declination for equatorial observations.

### `Ecliptic Coordinates`

Aligns with Earth’s orbital plane, useful for solar system dynamics.

### `Horizontal Coordinates`

Local observer-centric system (altitude/azimuth), common in ground-based telescopes.

### `Celestial Coordinates`

Generalized framework for celestial mechanics, including spherical coordinates.

### `Heliocentric System`

Earth-centered frame relative to the Sun, critical for planetary motion studies.

### `Barycentric System`

Sun-centered frame accounting for gravitational influences of planets.

### `Local Group Frame`

Aligns with the Local Group galaxy cluster for large-scale galactic studies.

### `Cosmic Microwave Background Frame`

Defines the universe’s early expansion reference.

### `Proper Motion Coordinates`

Tracks stellar movement over time, accounting for parallax.

### `Radial Velocity System`

Measures object speed toward/away from Earth via Doppler shifts.

### `Parallax Measurements`

Determines distance via angular displacement from Earth’s orbit.

### `Photometric Coordinates`

Relates brightness measurements to celestial coordinates.

### `Spectroscopic Position`

Uses Doppler shifts in spectral lines for velocity and composition analysis.

### `Interferometric Frame`

Combines signals from multiple telescopes for high-resolution imaging.

### `Gravitational Coordinates`

Adapts to general relativity for relativistic astrophysics.

### `Relativistic Frame`

Accounts for spacetime curvature in high-energy astrophysical contexts.

## Usage

This reference is used by astronomers, astrophysicists, and engineers to:
- Translate between coordinate systems (e.g., convert Galactic to Equatorial).
- Interpret observational data (e.g., proper motion, parallax).
- Design instruments (e.g., spectrographs, interferometers) aligned with specific frames.
- Model celestial dynamics (e.g., orbital mechanics, relativistic effects).

>[!INFO] Key Application
> Many modern telescopes (e.g., Hubble, ALMA) rely on multiple coordinate systems simultaneously for calibration and data reduction.

>[!WARNING] Frame Ambiguity
> Misalignment between frames (e.g., equatorial vs. ecliptic) can lead to errors in astrometry or kinematic analyses. Always verify the reference frame in observations.
