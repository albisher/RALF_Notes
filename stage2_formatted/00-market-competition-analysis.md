## Summary

```
Compares HMRS (Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System) against competitors in drone swarm simulation, autonomous building cleaning, and multi-robot coordination markets.
```

## Details

> This document analyzes HMRS’s position relative to existing platforms in three overlapping markets: drone swarm simulation, autonomous building cleaning, and multi-robot coordination. It categorizes competitors by their primary use cases and highlights key features, such as simulation capabilities, precision, and coordination algorithms. The analysis includes cloud-based SaaS tools, ROS-based frameworks, and proprietary commercial solutions, emphasizing differences in scalability, precision, and research applicability.

## Key Functions

### `Market Segmentation`

Classifies competitors into drone swarm simulation, building cleaning, and multi-robot coordination categories.

### `Feature Comparison`

Provides tabular breakdowns of platforms/products, listing primary use, type, and distinguishing features.

### `Research/Commercial Focus`

Differentiates between research-oriented (e.g., SwarmLab, AirSim) and commercial solutions (e.g., KTV Working Drone, Lucid Bots).

## Usage

This document serves as a reference for evaluating HMRS’s competitive edge, identifying gaps, and guiding strategic decisions in simulation, coordination, or commercial deployment.

## Dependencies

>[!INFO] **Market Overlap**: HMRS bridges gaps between simulation (e.g., AirSim) and real-world deployment (e.g., KTV Working Drone), addressing both research and commercial needs.

>[!WARNING] **Precision Trade-offs**: Commercial drones (e.g., Lucid Bots) prioritize centimeter-level accuracy for cleaning, while simulation platforms may lack real-world sensor fidelity.
