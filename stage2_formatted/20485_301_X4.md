## Summary

```
Log documenting agricultural challenges on Sol 301 (20485) regarding soil nutrient deficiencies and crop exposure to radiation, emphasizing self-sustainability solutions.
```

## Details

> The log details a critical nutrient deficiency (nitrates and phosphates) in soil, impacting crop root health despite adequate other nutrients. Initial crop tests under blue sun radiation show mixed results, requiring further testing under varied gravity and lighting conditions. The team must address inefficient water use and explore soil remediation (vs. importing materials) to achieve self-sustainability, as mandated by directives. The primary challenge is selecting appropriate crops for planting, anticipating future tool limitations.

## Key Functions

### `Soil nutrient analysis`

Identifies deficiencies in nitrates/phosphates, prioritizing remediation over imports.

### `Crop radiation testing`

Assesses growth/leaf damage under blue sun exposure, guiding further experimental conditions.

### `Resource allocation`

Compares energy costs of soil remediation vs. material imports to balance sustainability and feasibility.

### `Crop selection`

Evaluates plant suitability for future deployment, considering tool constraints.

## Usage

This log serves as a decision log for agricultural operations, guiding:
1. Soil remediation strategies (e.g., nutrient amendments).
2. Crop selection for resilience under current/anticipated conditions.
3. Energy-efficient resource management to meet self-sustainability goals.

## Dependencies

> `- **X11**: Transmits data to the main board for analysis.
- **X8**: Provides detailed crop/soil data for validation.
- **Blue city infrastructure**: Facilitates controlled testing under varied gravity/lighting.`

>[!INFO] Critical Nutrient Gap
> Nitrate/phosphate deficiency directly threatens root development, necessitating immediate soil intervention. Delay risks irreversible crop failure.

>[!WARNING] Radiation Variability
> Mixed growth outcomes under blue sun exposure highlight the need for iterative testing across multiple parameters (gravity, angles, areas). Inconsistent results may indicate environmental or genetic factors requiring deeper study.
